The actors play Billie Connelly and Brad Simon, respectively on the Netflix series.</p><p>“They’re a delight,” Hudecki told Us of <a href=#>the real-life couple</a>. “We didn’t get to do very much with the two of them this season. So every time we did it was very easy.”</p><p>The Canadian-based fight director added: “They were like, ‘Yep, we know this, we know that we know this.’ We had a very nice shorthand.”</p><p>Shahi and Demos confirmed their romance on New Year’s Eve in 2020 after meeting on the set of the Netflix drama earlier that year. The relationship came a few months after <a href=#>Us exclusively confirmed</a> in June 2020 that <a href=#>the Texas native split from husband <strong>Steve Howey</strong></a> after 11 years of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sarah-Shahi-and-Adam-Demos-Were-%E2%80%98Free-to-Have-a-Lot-More-Fun-and-Play-on-%E2%80%98Sex-Life-Season-2-Says-Intimacy-Coordinator-2.jpg><p>The L Word alum, who shares <a href=#>son William, 13, and twins Violet and Knox, 8</a>, with the <a href=#>Shameless</a> alum, 45, <a href=#>finalized her divorce in January 2021</a>.</p><p>Later that month, Demos gushed over Shahi on her birthday. “Happy bday my baby, I f*#kin love you. You’re everything,” he wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p>The Black Adam actress <a href=#>returned the favor on Demos’ special day</a> in May 2021. “I do know I found my forever. I do know I’ve never loved deeper, harder, more ferociously,” Shahi wrote via social media. “I do know I’m overly grateful for him. I do know I’ve loved him for a thousand lifetimes before and will love him for a thousand lifetimes more.”</p><p>The couple confirmed they are still going strong by <a href=#>packing on the PDA</a> at the February premiere of <a href=#>Sex/Life season 2</a> in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sex/Life season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqesF2htqex0maqmqqRnXq0tMChoGaZlJa6brDEpqasZZiWsW65zqucZp6lo3qwuoysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-has-89-puzzles-to-decode-before-1989-vault-titles-drop.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Has 89 Puzzles to Decode Before 1989 Vault Titles Drop</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-carpenter-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-37915-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Carpenter Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
