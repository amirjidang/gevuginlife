84 episodes and five seasons, Arrested Development was able to become one of the most popular television shows of the last decade, with its dry humor and family-orientated storyline, the show became a quick hit amongst fans.</p><p>With episodes not lasting too long, but always providing laughs, the show was easy to watch yet equally gripping with its continued story that was also packed full of heart and emotions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED<a href=#>: The Net Worth Of The Toy Story Cast, Ranked</a></span></p><p>The reason it worked so well was that the main cast was fairly small knit, but thankfully the cast of actors and actresses were fantastic, and in this article, we will rank them in terms of <a href=#>net worth</a>.</p><h2 id=jessica-walker-net-worth-4-million>Jessica Walker (Net Worth: $4 Million)</h2><p>Unlike the vast majority of the Bluth family, Jessica Walker's character, Lucille Bluth does have some brains about her, and certainly knows what she is doing, even though she is quite sly about what she does.</p><p>Lucille plays her children against each other knowingly, plotting to always get people to do various things for her, even though at her core she is very family orientated and loves them all, the dual personalities are a lot of fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Away from the show, Walker has earned a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a> through shows such as&nbsp;The Love Boat, Three's a Crowd, Trapper John, and many more, although Arrested Development remains her stand out role.</p><h2 id=alia-shawkat-net-worth-4-million>Alia Shawkat (Net Worth: $4 Million)</h2><p>Alia Shawkat was part of Arrested Development at a young age and she quickly showed the talent that she has as an actress with some incredible performances on the show, providing some of the funniest moments throughout.</p><p>Alia delivered some incredibly dry humor in this show as&nbsp;Maeby Fünke, often being neglected by her own parents, Maeby was left to her own devices throughout much of the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Breaking Bad: The 10 Richest Cast Members, Ranked&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Arrested Development played a key role in her career, earning a net worth of<a href=#> $4 million </a>with the popular comedy show being the main part of that.</p><h2 id=tony-hale-net-worth-9-million>Tony Hale (Net Worth: $9 Million)</h2><p>Tony Hale really does play the total idiot to perfection, with his character,&nbsp;Buster Bluth having no real sense of what he is doing from the start of the show to the finish, with Buster going through the wringer at times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone on the show provides comedy, it is Buster who brings the slapstick style laughs to the show, doing some truly ridiculous things throughout the show, but always with the family at the heart of his ideas.</p><p>Away from <a href=#>Arrested Development</a>, Hale's biggest role came working with Pixar as he is a cast member in Toy Story 4 where he voices a new character, Forky, helping to develop his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$9 million</a> net worth.</p><h2 id=david-cross-net-worth-12-million>David Cross (Net Worth: $12 Million)</h2><p>While David Cross' character,&nbsp;Tobias Fünke may not be born into the family, instead he chose to marry into it, but he certainly fits in perfectly with the way the whole family behaves and acts.</p><p>Tobias attempts to become an actor on the show, going as far as to become a stand-in for the Blue Man Group, with Tobias being one of the funniest characters on the entire show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of The American Horror Story Cast, Ranked&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>His entire career has been spent primarily in the comedy world, helping to grow

ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-arnett-net-worth-12-million>Will Arnett (Net Worth: $12 Million)</h2><p>Will Arnett plays the role of&nbsp;George Oscar "Gob" Bluth II in Arrested Development, a show which, interestingly, he had to be convinced to go and even audition for, even though it would go on to be a significant role for him.</p><p>Arnett's character, much like many of the family, is a fairly dumb adult who dreams of being a magician, although many of his plans and tricks end up going disastrously wrong, creating some hilarious moments for the show.</p><p>Apart from his fantastic performances in the Bluth family home, Arnett earned his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $12 million net worth </a>through roles in movies such as The Millers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Office.</p><h2 id=jeffrey-tambor-net-worth-16-million>Jeffrey Tambor (Net Worth: $16 Million)</h2><p>One of the

show begins.</p><p>Being arrested for his practices, George Bluth is quickly taken to prison where some incredible scenes take place, and Tambor actually pulls double duty on the show having a second role, playing George's brother, Oscar Bluth as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of the television show Tambor has also appeared in the likes of Hellboy, The Hangover, and The Larry Sanders Show, growing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $16 million in the process.</p><h2 id=portia-de-rossi-net-worth-20-million>Portia de Rossi (Net Worth: $20 Million)</h2><p>Portia de Rossi plays George Bluth's only daughter, Lindsay Bluth, who is married (despite the fact she wishes she wasn't) to Tobias, with the pair having a complicated relationship at best.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Crazy Expensive Things Ellen DeGeneres Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Portia's character doesn't like to work, and is extremely lazy in nature, often conflicting with members of her family because of it, but that doesn't mean she is mean natured by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>de Rossi also happens to be the partner of the popular talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres, making their family income incredible high when you put de Rossi's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;$20 million</a> net worth along with Ellen's value.</p><h2 id=michael-cera-net-worth-20-million>Michael Cera (Net Worth: $20 Million)</h2><p>Arrested Development was a real launching platform for Michael Cera, and it is unlikely he would have imagined having a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million</a> net worth when he first started working on the hit comedy show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom

Gloria Bell, amongst much more.</p><h2 id=henry-winkler-net-worth-30-million>Henry Winkler (Net Worth: $30 Million)</h2><p>Arrested Development has plenty of guest stars who appear throughout the show, but the one who makes the most appearances happens to be legendary actor, Henry Winkler, who works as the family lawyer,&nbsp;Barry Zuckerkorn.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Beers In The World&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>On the show, Winkler's character really has no right to be involved in the practice of law, as he really doesn't do a great job, yet the family is always forced to stick with him each time they need someone.</p><p>In reality, Winkley is a legend in the acting world, earning a net worth of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $30 million </a>throughout his career, being most famously known for his role in Happy Days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom
