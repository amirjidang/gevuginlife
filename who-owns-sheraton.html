Let’s delve into the fascinating story behind the Sheraton brand.</p><p>Sheraton Hotels and Resorts was founded by <b>Ernest Henderson</b> and <b>Robert Moore</b> in 1937 as the <b>Standard Equities Corporation</b>. The name ‘Sheraton’ was inspired by the third hotel they acquired, which prominently displayed a lighted sign with the name “Sheraton Hotel”.</p><p>Since its inception, Sheraton has grown rapidly and gained immense recognition as one of the leading hotel chains globally. Today, it operates 446 hotels with 155,617 rooms across the world, catering to the diverse needs of travelers.</p><p>In terms of ownership, Sheraton is currently owned by <b>Marriott International</b>, a prominent name in the hospitality industry. <b>Marriott International</b> acquired Sheraton in 2016, further strengthening its position as the world’s largest hotel and resort company.</p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Sheraton Hotels and Resorts was founded in 1937 by <b>Ernest Henderson</b> and <b>Robert Moore</b> as the <b>Standard Equities Corporation</b>.</li><li>The name ‘Sheraton’ was derived from the third hotel they acquired, which prominently displayed the name “Sheraton Hotel” on its roof.</li><li>Sheraton is currently owned by <b>Marriott International</b>, a renowned name in the hospitality industry.</li><li>As of now, Sheraton operates 446 hotels with 155,617 rooms globally.</li><li>Marriott International’s acquisition of Sheraton in 2016 solidified its position as the world’s largest hotel and resort company.</li></ul><h2>Sheraton’s Early Years</h2><p>In the early 1930s, <b>Ernest Henderson</b> and <b>Robert Moore</b> embarked on their journey to establish the renowned Sheraton Hotels and Resorts. It all began in 1933 when they acquired the Continental Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, marking their entry into the hospitality industry. Four years later, in 1937, Henderson and Moore officially formed the <b>Standard Equities Corporation</b> as the platform for their hotel operations.</p><p>The company initially acquired several hotels along the East Coast of the United States, stretching from Maine to Florida. However, it was their third acquisition, the <b>Stonehaven Hotel</b> in Springfield, Massachusetts, that would shape the future of their brand. The <b>Stonehaven Hotel</b> stood out with its prominent lighted sign that read “Sheraton Hotel” on the roof.</p><p>Fascinated by this striking feature, Henderson and Moore decided to adopt the name “Sheraton” for all their hotels. This marked the birth of Sheraton Hotels, a brand that would soon become synonymous with exceptional hospitality.</p><p>Driven by their passion for providing memorable experiences, Henderson and Moore swiftly expanded their hotel portfolio by acquiring existing properties along the East Coast. This strategic growth strategy allowed Sheraton to establish a strong presence and gain recognition for its commitment to quality and service.</p><p>In the next section, we will explore Sheraton’s remarkable expansion and its journey towards becoming a globally recognized hotel brand.</p><h3>Sheraton’s Early Years Overview:</h3><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Key Milestones</th></tr><tr><td>1933</td><td>Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore acquire the Continental Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td>1937</td><td>Formation of the Standard Equities Corporation</td></tr><tr><td>1937</td><td>Opening of the <b>Stonehaven Hotel</b> in Springfield, Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td>1937</td><td>Adoption of the name “Sheraton” for all hotels</td></tr></table><h2>Sheraton’s Expansion</h2><p>In its pursuit of global growth and market dominance, Sheraton embarked on an ambitious expansion strategy that solidified its position as a leading international hotel chain. Let’s explore the key milestones in Sheraton’s expansion journey.</p><h3>Acquisition of Ford Hotels Chain</h3><p>In 1949, Sheraton made its first foray into international markets by acquiring the renowned <b>Ford Hotels chain</b> in Canada. This strategic move presented an opportunity for Sheraton to establish a strong presence in the Canadian hospitality industry.</p><p>As part of its expansion strategy, Sheraton resold some of the properties it acquired from Ford Hotels to finance further Canadian expansion initiatives. This enabled the chain to optimize its portfolio and channel resources toward fueling growth.</p><h3>Purchase of Eppley Hotel Company</h3><p>Recognizing the potential within the United States, Sheraton made a significant acquisition in 1956 by purchasing the <b>Eppley Hotel Company</b>, which was the largest privately held hotel business in the country at that time.</p><p>From the Eppley Hotel Company’s portfolio, Sheraton strategically retained ten of the largest hotels and resold the remaining twelve, generating funds that could be invested in expanding its reach both domestically and internationally.</p><h3>Venturing Beyond North America</h3><p>During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sheraton made notable strides in expanding its footprint globally by opening its first hotels outside the United States and Canada.</p><p>Internationally, Sheraton’s growing presence included iconic properties such as the <b>Sheraton-Tel Aviv Hotel</b> in Israel, the <b>Sheraton-Kingston Hotel</b> in Jamaica, and the <b>Sheraton-British Colonial Hotel</b> in the Bahamas.</p><p>Through these strategic acquisitions and international openings, Sheraton laid the foundation for its global success, paving the way for further growth and establishing the brand as a preferred choice for travelers across the world.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Sheraton-expansion-1024x585.jpg alt="Sheraton expansion" title="Sheraton expansion" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Stay tuned for the next section to learn more about the significant ownership changes that shaped Sheraton’s journey.</p><h2>ITT Purchase</h2><p>In 1968, the multinational conglomerate <b>ITT Corporation</b> acquired Sheraton, leading to the brand being known as <b>ITT Sheraton</b>. This acquisition marked a significant ownership change for Sheraton, bringing it under the umbrella of the <b>ITT Corporation</b>. Under ITT’s ownership, Sheraton underwent a strategic shift in its business model, moving away from direct ownership and operation of properties to a focus on franchising and management.</p><p>One notable development during ITT’s ownership was the creation of the <b>ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection</b> in 1992. This collection consisted of Sheraton’s premier hotels and towers, offering a high-end and luxurious experience for guests. The <b>ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection</b> included iconic properties such as The St. Regis in New York City, further solidifying Sheraton’s position in the luxury hotel market.</p><p>In 1998, <b>ITT Sheraton</b> went through another change in ownership when it was acquired by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. As a result, the brand name reverted back to Sheraton, and it became part of the broader Starwood portfolio.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ITT-Sheraton-1024x585.jpg alt="ITT Sheraton" title="ITT Sheraton" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Starwood Purchase</h2><p>In 1998, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide made a significant acquisition by purchasing <b>ITT Sheraton</b> for $13.3 billion, outbidding its competitor Hilton. This acquisition marked a new chapter for Sheraton, as it entered a period of rebranding and transformation under <b>Starwood’s leadership</b>.</p><p>Under Starwood’s guidance, Sheraton embarked on an extensive renovation program to enhance the quality and design of its hotels. This renovation effort aimed to create modern, stylish spaces that catered to the evolving needs and expectations of guests.</p><p>The acquisition also led to Sheraton’s expansion on a global scale, allowing the brand to extend its footprint to various destinations around the world. One notable development was the introduction of the “Sheraton Grand” brand in 2015, featuring upscale properties located in urban and resort settings.</p><p><b>Starwood’s leadership</b> and resources provided Sheraton with a platform for growth and innovation, enabling the brand to solidify its position as a leading player in the hospitality industry.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Starwood-acquisition-1024x585.jpg alt="Starwood acquisition" title="Starwood acquisition" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Sheraton Hotel Renovation Progress</h3><p>To illustrate Sheraton’s commitment to its renovation program, here is an overview of the progress made:</p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Renovated Hotels</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>2021 (YTD)</td><td>9</td></tr></table><p>As shown in the table above, Sheraton has consistently invested in its renovation efforts, improving multiple properties each year.

This strategic move solidified Marriott International’s position as the largest hotel and resort company in the world, expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio of iconic hospitality brands.</p><p>Sheraton’s status as a world-class hotel company was further solidified through its integration into Marriott International’s vast network of brands.</p><p>While Sheraton has enjoyed a strong reputation in Asia, it has faced challenges in the US market due to the aging properties within its portfolio.
