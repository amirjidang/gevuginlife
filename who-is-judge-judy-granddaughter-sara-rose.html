Rose is set to debut alongside Sheindlin on Judy Justice, and viewers will get to witness who<strong> Sara Rose</strong> is and whether the apple (grand apple) has fallen far from the tree.</p><h2 id=she-will-be-serving-as-a-law-clerk-on-39-judy-justice-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Will Be Serving As A Law Clerk On 'Judy Justice'</span></h2><p><strong>Rose</strong> will be front and center on <strong>Judy Justice</strong>. Seated to her grandmother’s right side, <strong>Rose</strong> will be serving as a law clerk on the reality court show. In a nutshell, Sara will be serving as Judy’s right-hand woman. An honor in and of itself, this position is generally granted to recent law graduates who have excelled within their class. The position is considered highly prestigious, and filling this position alongside one of America’s most famous TV judges makes the honor seemingly that much sweeter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=law-is-in-her-blood><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Law Is In Her Blood</span></h2><p>Family legacies are often a source of pride and can serve as a way of bonding with family members to a certain degree. Being born into a family of lawyers, <strong>Sara Rose</strong> may have almost been destined to enter the field of justice. A third-generation female family lawyer within the family, <strong>Rose’s </strong>lineage is deeply entrenched in the law. Furthermore, many of her siblings as well as one of her parents is also a lawyer. Suffice to say, you wouldn't want to conduct yourself unlawfully in that particular household, to say the least.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Judge Judy Is Worth $420 Million: 15 Pics That Show How She Amassed Her Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-ba-in-communications-and-a-business-law-degree><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Has A BA In Communications And A Business Law Degree</span></h2><p><strong>Sara </strong>is not only serving as her grandmother’s right hand woman, but she is also stepping up to the podium with the education as well as legal chops to take care of business. Receiving a Bachelor of Arts in communication as well as a business law degree from the University of Southern California in 2019, Rose has the know-how to back up her legendary grandmother within the courtroom, which is indeed no small feat.</p><h2 id=she-is-one-of-thirteen-grandchildren><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Is One Of Thirteen Grandchildren</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a member of a large family is one thing; however, being one of thirteen grandchildren (many of whom are interested in entering the field of law) is an entirely different ball of wax.<strong> Rose</strong> is but one of the many faces that can call<strong> Judge Judy Sheidlin</strong> their grandmother. As overwhelming as being the law clerk of <strong>Judge Judy</strong> surely is, coming from such a large family has likely done much to quell Rose’s hardship worries (if any) in terms of what she may face on Judy Justice.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> ‘Judge Judy’ Is Ending After 25 Seasons</a></span></p><h2 id=she-worked-as-an-intern-in-the-putnam-county-district-attorney-39-s-office-in-new-york><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Worked As An Intern In The Putnam County District Attorney's Office In New York</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going from the halls of a prestigious university to walking down the corridors of the district attorney's office is quite the step; a step <strong>Sara Rose</strong> took after graduating from the University of Southern California back in 2019.

Furthermore, Rose has also worked as the social media coordinator for Her Honor Mentoring. With her past experience dealing with the world of television,<strong> Rose</strong> brings a respectable resume to the courtroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rose-may-share-some-personality-traits-with-her-grandmother><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rose May Share Some Personality Traits With Her Grandmother</span></h2><p>It's not too hard to believe that a person growing up within the household of the offspring of <strong>Judge Judy</strong> might end up inheriting some of her rather quirky traits. In the trailer for her upcoming show, Judy Justice, Judge Judy spoke about her granddaughter and resident law clerk. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the trailer, which can be found on IMDBtv’s<strong>YouTube</strong> page</a>, <strong>Sheindlin</strong> said, “I've been sort of alone for the past 25 years, now I have a new team. My law clerk happens to be my granddaughter,” she continued, “Sara is wired like I am; she's a little snarky… I like that.” Judy has also commented on the similarities she and her granddaughter share with this quote from Yahoo, “I've known Sarah, our law clerk, since she was born. She will be a third-generation female lawyer in our family. She's smart, sassy, and opinionated. Who knows where she gets those traits?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> This 'Storage Wars' Cast Member Reveals What A&E Didn't Show Us</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButtSdnp5lmqqxunnGq5innJSWwqi0056pZquRp65uvs6snGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-new-york-magazine-reporter-olivia-nuzzi-is-she-married.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is New York Magazine Reporter Olivia Nuzzi?
