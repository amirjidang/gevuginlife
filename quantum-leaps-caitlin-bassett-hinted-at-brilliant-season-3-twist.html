Or not.’ It was a brilliant move by the writers and the last episode — it just feels like a new adventure. It’s so cool. So I hope people enjoy it.”</p><p>During the season 2 finale, which aired on Tuesday, February 20, the Quantum Leap team <a href=#>figured out a way to bring Ben (<strong>Raymond Lee</strong>) home</a> after he spent two seasons leaping through time. The plan was to use a code that would swap Ben out for Addison (Bassett), who would take her ex-fiancé’s place with the time travel mission.</p><p>Addison did end up being taken back in time but she wasn’t alone. Ben had also leaped into that moment instead of returning to present time. The couple reunited for the first time in years and were finally able to be together again.</p><p>The narrative decision came as a surprise <a href=#>since in the original Quantum Leap series</a> Sam (<strong>Scott Bakula</strong>) leaped by himself. Allowing another person to travel through time with Ben opened the door for more possibilities — and questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Quantum-Leaps-Caitlin-Bassett-Teased-Brilliant-Narrative-Shakeup-Ahead-of-Season-3-Twist-02.jpg><p>Lee, 37, recently told Us about what fans could expect <a href=#>if Quantum Leap is renewed</a> for a third season.</p><p>“[The finale achieved] tying not only the loose ends of season 2, but all of season 1 as well. And to also just deliver on a level emotionally where we would feel satisfied as fans and as characters,” he shared. “I feel like there was no tether that was left knotted and also another dimension to another door possible if we were to go further. So I’m just so impressed. Not surprised, just incredibly impressed with everybody that was responsible for making that episode.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lee also discussed <a href=#>how much insight he was given</a> into the show’s future, saying, “I know where this should all go and I’m so trusting of [the writers’] storytelling and taste. I just know that now that we’ve really understood what we’re good at now, we can just kind of let it rip even more than we have.”</p><p>He concluded: “But yeah, no indicators yet of what the story is [in season 3] or where we’re even at in terms of a renewal. But all I can say is that I’m very fulfilled and happy with the journey that we’ve had so far, and for the fans and for myself and for all of our group. We just want to tell more story.”</p><p>Quantum Leap is available to stream on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKiumZ6pwq55y56YqatdmK6qwMuipWaakajApsDTZp%2BipqSasW6t02aZq6GcobaiutNmqp6Zo6S7bn%2BMra6iq6Rk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./redmond-oneal-26-arrested-for-heroin-possession-201128.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Redmond O'Neal, 26, Arrested for Heroin Possession</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-schwarzenegger-abby-champions-relationship-timeline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Schwarzenegger, Abby Champion's Relationship Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
