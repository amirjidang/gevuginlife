However, <a href=#>Kourtney</a> chose to go with a relatively inexpensive option (at least for the Kardashian family) during her courthouse marriage to Travis Barker earlier this month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, the white Dolce & Gabana minidress <a href=#>Kourtney sported for the event cost $1,900</a>. While that’s certainly no small investment, the price pales in comparison to the money some of Kourtney’s sisters have put down on wedding dresses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Super Dad’ Kanye West Rents Fire Truck For School Drop Off</a></span></p><p>Kim’s 2014 marriage to Kanye in Florence, Italy saw the reality star wedding a $500,000 custom Givenchy dress, designed by her friend Riccardo Tisci.</p><p>The SKIMS founder also spared no expense during her wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011. The televised event cost a reported $10 million in total, while $150,000 was spent on Kim’s three dress changes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Khloe Kardashian’s wedding dress during her 2009 nuptials to Lamar Odom reportedly cost more than Kourtney’s recent pick. Khloe rocked a custom silk Vera Wang gown, valued between $4,000-6,000.</p><p>However, Kourtney’s going to have more than one wedding dress. The Poosh founder’s courthouse ceremony was a low-key event because it was only necessary in order to legally officiate the wedding. Kourtney and Travis are holding a larger celebration in Italy for their loved ones this weekend.</p><p>On Friday, we reported that the couple were spotted <a href=#>getting cozy on a $60 million yacht</a> with their children after arriving in Italy. The yacht, known as the Regina D’Italia, used to be owned by Dolce and Gabbana’s founder Stefano Gabbana.</p><p>Kourtney and Travis’s loved ones have been seen arriving ahead of the highly anticipated ceremony. Her sisters Kim, Khloe, Kylie, and Kendall have all been photographed in Italy as well as her mother Kris Jenner and her partner Corey Gamble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears that while some of Kourtney’s nieces and nephews have come abroad (Stormi has&nbsp;been photographed with mom Kylie), not all of them are joining the festivities. Khloe’s daughter True has been seen spending time with her dad, Tristan Thompson, on social media while her mom is in Italy.</p><p>Kourtney and Travis went public with their relationship early last year and <a href=#>were engaged by October</a>. They had an unofficial wedding in Las Vegas last month, though their union was later officialised at the court ceremony.</p><p>The pair have confirmed they’d like to have a child together – Kourtney has even begun the IVF process, as documented on The Kardashians. She already shares three kids with her ex Scott Disick, while Travis has two children with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Scott’s Nike Drop Is So Popular, A Raffle Was Held For Buyers</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>Hello Magazine</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qorKusnprGbrfAq5uaq5ierq95w6ijnJ1dnK6jrc2nmGavlZmxqrrGZpurnaOoeqq6xLGnnqajnsOmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-iggy-azalea-other-celebs-who-hid-their-pregnancies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner, Iggy Azalea, &amp;amp; Other Celebs Who Hid Their Pregnancies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashians-kkw-beauty-rebranding-coty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty Rebranding After Selling to Coty Inc.
