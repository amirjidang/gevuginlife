We started joking about going down to <b><span>Atlantic City</span></b>, it was funny because we were <a href=#>just there the night before</a>. Not too funny though, because Reena and I live in the moment and do whatever. Soon enough I called Resorts for a room, then we got ready, jumped into the car and drove down to <b><span>Resorts</span></b> again. We left at midnight, arrived at 1am, played for an hour at the Craps tables <i>(won a nice $800 off some sweet horn bets!)</i>, then grabbed something to eat with our comps.</p><p>After some quick gambling and grabbing something to eat, we headed up to the room. Before driving down, I requested a room in their new tower, since last time we were in such a <a href=#>horrible room</a> and the beds were so hard and square. At the <b><span>Ultra Members</span></b> only cocktail party the day before, we talked to a couple that said the towers in the new hotel were great. So once arriving I told the lady to set us up in a room in the new tower, and she said that was fine. While looking for the new tower, we noticed it was the same path we took the first time we stayed over. We went up to the room and it was the same type! Same crappy bed and this one smelled like a pet store. Unhappy <u>again</u>, I called down to the main desk to see if they had any suites to upgrade to, they said none. I then called housekeeping and asked for four new pillows and a blanket. About a half an hour after calling, no one ever showed up, so we just decided to leave again. Once again, we drove all the way down to Resorts and got a room, but left without staying in it for more than an hour. Unless I am ever offered a suite, it looks like Resorts is simply a hit and run casino, no stay overs. The good thing is we made a quick profit and got a free dinner, bad part was the driving back and fourth longer was actually longer than the amount of time we stayed there! Go for the game play, gifts and comps… not the rooms!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunCzwKaZpZ2iqHqquoytn55lnp60qcCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./halle-bailey-ddg-relationship-glamour-1234759297.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Halle Bailey Responds To &amp;quot;Concerns&amp;quot; About Relationship With DDG</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./freddy-peralta-mlb-parents-meet-pedro-peralta-octavia-diaz-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Freddy Peralta MLB Parents: Meet Pedro Peralta &amp;amp; Octavia Diaz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
