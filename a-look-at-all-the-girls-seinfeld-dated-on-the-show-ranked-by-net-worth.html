Amidst the daily shenanigans of the characters, <a href=#>Jerry has experienced</a> relationships from embarrassing to catastrophic. Most of the show’s storyline is also based on the satirical representation of the ups and downs in relationships through the character’s many breakups and patch-ups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although many television shows have featured a ‘will they or won’t they’ plotlines, Larry David ensured that <i>Seinfeld</i> would be as raw as possible and that the characters would not be learning from their mistakes. Consequently, every character on the show had multiple relationships, failures, and successes. From Courtney Cox, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Teri Hatcher, Jerry Seinfeld dated 73 girls during the show.</p><h2 id=valerie---lauren-graham-15-million>Valerie - Lauren Graham ($15 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <i>Gilmore Girls</i> actress made a one-episode appearance on <i>Seinfeld</i> three years before her acting career boomed as Lorelai Gilmore and Sarah Braverman in <i>Parenthood</i>. In the 8th season, Lauran Graham’s role as Valerie was similar to her later character roles, quirky, fun, and lighthearted. Valerie is funnier than most of Jerry Seinfeld’s girlfriends and has an unusual quirk of reordering speed dial numbers on her phone. The amusing storyline lasted for just one episode, and their relationship ended with Valerie being disappointed to hear Jerry’s voice on the phone.</p><h2 id=marla---jane-leeves-16-million>Marla - Jane Leeves ($16 million)</h2><p>Jane Leeves perfectly portrayed Marla Penny as a virgin. The lead character, Jerry, was happy to wait until she was ready, but a contest in the storyline of the second episode features Leeves being horrified by Jerry and his friends. Jane has had a successful acting career and got her breakthrough role in the famous sitcom <i>Frasier</i>. However, before she made it to stardom through her role as Daphne Moon, Jane Leeves was a part of the show <i>Throb </i>for two years and also did nine episodes of <i>Murphy Brown</i> before her two-episode role in <i>Seinfeld</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna---kristin-davis-35-million>Jenna - Kristin Davis ($35 Million)</h2><p>Kristin Davis, aka Jenna, appeared for two episodes on <i>Seinfeld</i> as one of Jerry’s girlfriends in season 8. The famous ‘Pothole’ episode features a storyline where Jerry accidentally drops her toothbrush in the toilet, and the couple’s short romance ends even after Jenna dumps his brush in the bathroom. Davis got her big break in the 1995 <i>Melrose Place</i>, after which she rose to stardom playing Charlotte in HBO’s <i>Sex and The City</i> movies. She also got an Emmy award nomination for her role in the famous rom-com franchise and <a href=#>earned an estimated $7 million for the two films</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's How Kristin Davis Made It Big In Hollywood" href=#>Here's How Kristin Davis Made It Big In Hollywood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sheila---alexandra-wentworth-40-million>Sheila - Alexandra Wentworth ($40 million)</h2><p>The Nightcap actress appeared in the 7th season of the show as Jerry Seinfeld’s ‘Schmoopie’ girlfriend. The episode shows a classic comedy of the protagonist showcasing PDA with her new girlfriend but eventually ends up leaving her and choosing delicious soup over the lovely Sheila. Alexandra Wentworth has played significant roles in acting, including Diane in Meryl Streep starring <i>It's Complicated</i> and Tom Cruise’s <i>Jerry Maguire</i>.</p><h2 id=sidra---teri-hatcher-50-million>Sidra - Teri Hatcher ($50 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A former NFL Cheerleader, Teri Hatcher’s character, Sidra, was infamous on Seinfeld for her iconic line when she broke up with Jerry. Teri gave full credit to Larry Davis for coming up with the joke on the spot, which became a highlight of the entire show, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VanityFair</a>. Hatcher has also played memorable characters, like Lois Lane in the 1993<i> Lois & Clark</i> and Susan Mayer in the 2004 drama<i> Desperate Housewives</i>.</p><h2 id=ellen---christine-taylor-50-million>Ellen - Christine Taylor ($50 million)</h2><p>Christine Taylor’s role on <i>Seinfeld</i> was short but memorable. Ellen was one of Jerry’s ‘normal’ love interests on the show, and her normalcy threw Seinfeld off guard. The plotline shows Jerry breaking up with Taylor after two episodes in the 8th season because of his confusion and self-sabotaging tendencies. Also a comedian, Christine has starred in various films and television shows like <i>Blossom</i>, <i>Murphy Brown</i>, and <i>Zoolander</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meryl---courteney-cox-150-million>Meryl - Courteney Cox ($150 Million)</h2><p>Courtney Cox, who played Monica Geller on the famous sitcom <i>Friends</i>, also appeared as Jerry Seinfeld’s girlfriend on the show. As per <a href=#>ScreenRant</a>, in Seinfeld’s 5th season, Cox’s character Meryl was Jerry’s super-serious girlfriend, and their romance truly clicked until she misused his laundry discount. Courtney is among the highest-paying sitcom actresses, and <a href=#>a large chunk of her $150 million net worth</a> has come from her role in <i>Friends</i>. Apart from playing sitcom roles, Courtney Cox was also seen in the horror comedy <i>Scream </i>and all its sequels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elaine---julia-louis-dreyfus-250-million>Elaine - Julia Louis-Dreyfus ($250 Million)</h2><p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus is one of the leading cast members of Seinfeld, along with Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, and Jerry Seinfeld. Julia is also one of the highest-paying actors in the show, earning $150,000 per episode for the first five seasons and $600,00 per episode for the rest of the show, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>. Elaine and Jerry started dating at the end of the 2nd season. Although it was obvious that the two were the perfect fit, the storyline did not revolve around their unsaid love, making it a treat for the fans even now.</p><p>Airing the pilot episode in July 1989, the series enjoyed a nine-year run on television and garnered a whopping $2.7 billion gross collection through its course. The sitcom Seinfeld has created an enormous fan base and is now available on OTT platforms for viewers to revisit the good old times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="All Of Naomi Campbell's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth" href=#>All Of Naomi Campbell's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>ScreenRant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowbizCheatSheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VanityFair</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmmaRirq24jK2fnmWXnr%2Btv4ysnKKmlpq5pXnDmquenF2ku27Ax55krKCfrHqzrc2knJ1lkq56r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-most-expensive-hotel-suites-in-the-world.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Most Expensive Hotel Suites in the World</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bat-chopper-check-out-neymar-jr-s-15-million-dollar-batman-helicopter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Bat Chopper: Check Out Neymar Jr.'s $15 Million Dollar Batman Helicopter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
