Routledge perfectly since the start. Did their break up make it difficult to keep filming the popular series, or was it business as usual for the actors?</p><h2 id=did-madelyn-cline-and-chase-stokes-get-along-on-the-set-of-outer-banks-post-break-up>Did Madelyn Cline And Chase Stokes Get Along On The Set Of Outer Banks Post-Break Up?</h2><p>Since Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes play Sarah and John B., two characters who fall in love with one another, it wasn't a huge surprise to learn that the actors were dating IRL. Sarah is part of the group called the Kooks and John B. runs the Pogues, which causes some tension. And, of course, these two groups make the show especially fun to watch since there's always something dramatic going on.</p><p>Did Cline and Stokes have trouble getting along when they had to film season 3 of Outer Banks? It turns out that they split up in the autumn months of 2021 and had to be on set in February 2022. For many people, this would have been impossible. Or at least pretty awkward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chase-stokes.jpg><p>The actors have remained totally polite with each other, however, and they seem to have put their personal life aside to focus on the characters that they love.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cline and Stokes talked about filming Outer Banks</a> with Entertainment Weekly in February 2023.

They haven't said that they spend time together outside of filming Outer Banks. And given their dramatic split, it's possible to guess that they don't hang out, especially since they're both in new relationships.</p><p>The actors continue to show one another kindness, however. According to Us Weekly, Chase Stokes praised Madelyn Cline in December 2021. He said, “She’s one of my favorite people on planet Earth. You know, it’s super awesome to work with somebody that you care about that much, and yeah, I’ll leave it at that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Madelyn Cline's Boyfriend After Her Chase Stokes Breakup</a></span></p><p>And since Netflix gave Outer Banks a season 4 renewal back in February 2023, it seems likely that the former couple will continue their polite working relationship when they have to film those new episodes.</p><h2 id=do-madelyn-cline-and-chase-stokes-support-each-other-39-s-new-relationships>Do Madelyn Cline And Chase Stokes Support Each Other's New Relationships?</h2><p>Both Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes are in new relationships.

But considering how polite they have been about working together, if they ever do say anything about each other's relationships, they will likely be kind and positive.</p><p>It's likely that Outer Banks will have several more seasons, due to how wildly popular it has become. And it's impressive that Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes shot season 3 as if nothing had actually happened between them.</p><p>It seems like they focused on the scripts and made sure that they did their jobs to the best of their abilities. And fans loved this season just as much as the two that came before it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpyVocavecKloKedXZa7pXnCoZisnV2owbC3xKxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXaS7brvUrZyrZZKWu6y%2FjJqdrZ2iYq%2BzscCkrKllkaOxbq%2FHnpitoZ6cerSvwKebmqRf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marcus-kemp-parents-meet-ronald-kemp-and-karen-martin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marcus Kemp Parents: Meet Ronald Kemp And Karen Martin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lucero-alejo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lucero Alejo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
