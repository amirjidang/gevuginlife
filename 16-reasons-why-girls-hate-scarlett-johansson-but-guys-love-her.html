Well, she is one of the most beloved actresses... but mostly just by dudes. That's right, it largely seems that ol' ScarJo appeals to a male audience in a particular way that she doesn’t appeal to a female audience. But, why? It would be easy to simply say that it's because men find ScarJo hot and women are jealous, but that’s not it. There are many beautiful women who appeal to female audiences, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Portman</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen</a>. Unlike these other beautiful women, Scarlett Johansson is more off-putting to a female audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To get to the bottom of this phenomenon, I’ve narrowed it down to 16 particular factors that make men LOVE Scarlett Johansson and women, uh, not so much. Sure, some of the factors are goofy, like a bad wig or bad rom-com performance, but this is the sh*t that women care about. I literally still think about Scarlett Johansson's performance in He’s Just Not That Into You and shudder. It matters, guys!</p><p>To be clear, this is not a slam piece on Scarlett Johansson whatsoever. She’s a beautiful, wealthy, successful individual. However, there is a difference in how one must market themselves to a male audience vs a female audience. So far in her career, Scarlett Johansson has been immensely more successful in marketing herself to a male audience, and here’s why…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-black-widow-wig-is-so-bad><strong>Her Black Widow Wig Is SO Bad</strong></h2><p>I know guys are super into Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, but I personally don’t love it. Listen, her body looks AMAZING in the costume, for which she reportedly toned up and slimmed down. She also does a fine job acting in the role. But, the costume and her acting ability are not the things that deeply bother me about ScarJo as Black Widow. The one thing that I cannot get over is her horrible, horrible Black Widow wig. It's tragic and it ruins everything for me.</p><p>I know this isn’t necessarily her fault per se, but shouldn’t she be like, "Uh, get me something that looks natural. For the love of god, this is a Marvel friggin’ film." They’re going to spend a zillion dollars on special effects and not get ScarJo a believable wig? Where are their priorities? I simply cannot concentrate on the end of the world if I'm staring at that horrid wig the whole time.</p><p>Like I said, this is not necessarily ol’ ScarJo’s fault, but I can’t really fawn over her as Black Widow because I’m too busy staring at that wig. Dudes, on the other hand, don’t notice the wig so they don’t have this problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-humble-like-at-all><strong>She's Not Humble, Like At All</strong></h2><p>The hard part about being a woman is that you’re supposed to be effortlessly hot, but also somehow have no idea that you’re so hot. Yes, the world expects us women to put all that work into looking the part and then be like, "Oh, me? I woke up looking like this. I’m such a hag. LOL." It’s annoying AF. That being said, I don’t need ScarJo to completely play the "Oh, me?" role, but it would help if she wasn’t so cocky. Is ScarJo really that cocky? Well, here is a quote from an interview: “Because I am an actor and all actors think that they are The One. It’s part of our huge egos and makes us so successful in some areas of our lives and not in others.”</p><p>Hm, okay. Here is a quote about her taking the role of Black Widow: “I wanted to stretch myself physically, out of my comfort zone, and still succeed. I’m probably like most actors. We have huge egos, and you want to know you can be successful, no matter what.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why does she keep talking about her HUGE ego? Calm down, girl. I don’t need ScarJo to magically be the most humble person in the world, but if she could just play the game a little bit that would be nice. Take a pointer from all the celebrities who talk about being bullied when they were younger or being romantically rejected. All you need is one story of that nature and BOOM, you’re relatable.</p><p>Of course, guys don't need her to be humble. They're fine with her cocky swagger.</p><h2 id=uh-she-said-this><strong>Uh, She Said This</strong></h2><p>At 32 years old, ScarJo has been divorced twice, which isn’t necessarily excessive by Hollywood standards. But still, for being 32, being divorced twice has to be emotionally difficult, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>ScarJo’s first marriage was to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds</a>, which lasted three years. Her second marriage was to Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter.&nbsp;Romain Dauriac and ScarJo divorced March of this year. With two failed marriages under her belt, it would be understandable for ScarJo to be cynical, but you have to put on the Hollywood show. You have to say how emotional it was and how heartbroken you are. You have to say that you’re going to remain friends with your ex, even if you actually hate their guts. It’s just what celebrities do. Well, here’s what ScarJo said in an interview, “I think the idea of marriage is very romantic; it’s a beautiful idea, and the practice of it can be a very beautiful thing. I don’t think it’s natural to be a monogamous person. I might be skewered for that, but I think it’s work. It’s a lot of work.”</p><p>Oh, so the sexiest, sultriest living actresses just said she doesn’t believe in monogamy? And, that’s exactly why guys love her and women do not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-vs-blake-lively><strong>Scarlett Johansson vs. Blake Lively</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson met Mr. Deadpool in 2007. They were married in 2008 and divorced in 2011. That’s their short love story and it's all well and fine, but everyone knows that Ryan Reynolds is now the most in love man ever. Like, no one has ever loved each other as much as Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. The way Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively love each other makes them seem like they literally came up with the concept of love together. Because of this, it's impossible not to compare Scarlett Johansson and Blake Lively. Now, it's not that I love pitting two young, blonde, extremely attractive actresses against each other, but they do have the Ryan Reynolds factor in common.</p><p>In the Scarlett Johansson vs. Blake Lively game, Blake Lively is much more relatable to other women. Lively is open and humble. She’s talked about the difficulty of losing the pregnancy weight and the failure of her short-lived blog. Of course, you can like both ScarJo and Blake Lively. I’m not saying you can’t be down with both women. But, it’s just that in comparison to Blake Lively, ScarJo comes off as even more unlikable, especially with Ryan Reynolds gushing his heart out about Blake Lively during literally every interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-great-in-romantic-comedies><strong>She's Not Great In Romantic Comedies</strong></h2><p>I like a wide range of films – horror, action, comedies, drama and, of course, romantic comedies. As a woman, I even like horrible romantic comedies. Yes, I know Bride Wars isn’t a "good" movie, but I’ll still watch it and feel happy. That being said, Scarlett Johansson's been in a few romantic comedies and she’s been rather lackluster in all of them. It’s not necessarily ScarJo’s fault. Some actresses are not equipped to carry a romantic comedy by themselves.</p><p>Being the lead of a romantic comedy requires the ability to act, but also the ability to be seemingly free on the screen. If you think about the most iconic romantic comedy stars – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Roberts</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bullock</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey Hepburn</a>, and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone</a> at this point – they have a certain vulnerability on the screen. Audiences don't know if they are acting or just being themselves. Their movements and facial expressions come across as unpredictable and genuine. ScarJo lacks this quality, which is why she thrives in such films as Lucy and Under the Skin, in which she played very measured, structured female characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>ScarJo doesn’t thrive in romantic comedies and thus, she loses some love for the female audience.</p><h2 id=she-often-plays-the-other-woman><strong>She Often Plays The Other Woman</strong></h2><p>Speaking of romantic comedies, was Scarlett Johansson not the least likeable character ever in He’s Just Not That Into You? I mean, seriously.</p><p>In the film, Scarlett Johansson plays a character who strings along&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Connolly</a>'s character all while having an affair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Cooper</a>'a married character. There’s even a scene in which ScarJo must hide in a closet while Bradley Cooper has sex with his wife, played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Connelly</a>. I think you’re supposed to feel bad for ScarJo in this moment, but her character was simply not one that elicited any kind of sympathy from the audience.</p><p>In Vicky Christina Barcelona, ScarJo once again plays the other woman, but in a much more complicated relationship. If she’s not playing the other woman, she often plays a man-eater, as she quite literally was in Under the Skin. Her sexuality is often a major point of her characters and, while men may love that, it can be off-putting for a female viewer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-always-the-object-of-affection><strong>She's Always The Object Of Affection</strong></h2><p>Still rolling with the note about Scarlett Johansson’s sexuality being present in all of her roles, I’ll point out that she’s ALWAYS the object of affection. Like, always. Is she ever in a movie in which she’s not being perused by a man in some way, shape or form? I mean, her role of Black Widow may not necessarily be all about the pursuit, but Marvel doesn’t dwell too long on romantic relationships in any of their films.</p><p>Listen, I get that ScarJo oozes sexuality from literally every single pore of her body. I understand that she’s overwhelmingly attractive. I’m pretty sure that most men just melt into a puddle when they see her. That being said, subverting your sexuality can sometimes be fun. I mean, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlize Theron</a> took on a very un-sexy role in Monster and it won her an Oscar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-we-all-get-over-her-voice><strong>Can We All Get Over Her Voice?</strong></h2><p>Even Scarlett Johansson’s voice is sexy. We all get it. Literally every single part of ScarJo is hot. Her toes are probably hot. Hell, her earwax is probably the sexiest earwax that has ever existed. But, can we all just relax about her voice already? It’s a sexy voice, with it being all deep and smooth. It's a reminder of Lauren BaCall's smoky voice. But, it’s still just a voice, you know?</p><p>If you think I'm exaggerating about people LOVING ScarJo's voice, I'm not. Her voice is so beloved that there was even talk of her getting an Oscar nomination for her voice-only role in Her, in which she played an operating system, y'know like Alexa.</p><p>While her voice is extremely sexy, it’s annoying that everyone has a forever-boner over it. Let’s all move on with our lives, shall we?</p><h2 id=she-never-gives-a-great-interview><strong>She Never Gives A Great Interview</strong></h2><p>For a female audience to love you, it’s not about just looking hot. There are so many good looking stars. In fact, almost every major Hollywood star is attractive to some degree. Sure, Scarlett Johansson is attractive to the highest degree, but that attractiveness alone will not win over a female audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What the female audience wants is someone to whom they can connect and relate. They want Jennifer Lawrence falling down the stairs at the Oscars, which, by the way, must have been strategically planned, right? It’s just way too on brand to be accidental. Females want someone like Chrissy Teigen, who posts photos of her stretch marks on social media. Females want someone like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>, who gives interviews that make every one feel like they are her best friend. Scarlett Johansson is not this person. She never really lets people know about private life or personality. There's never a viral interview, in which ScarJo knocks it out of the park.</p><p>I don’t fault Scarlett Johansson for being guarded and reserved. Hell, it’s admirable in today’s world, but female audiences want to emotionally connect to stars and ScarJo never lets her walls down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-on-social-media><strong>She's Not On Social Media</strong></h2><p>I find it refreshing when a huge star doesn’t do social media. In today’s day and age when some careers are made from social media followings alone, not having social media accounts seems like a small protest. However, social media accounts can count for a lot when it comes to fans, especially if you're not the type to really let people in during interviews. In this regard, being on social media could help Scarlett Johansson connect to fans. She is the exact celebrity who would benefit from using social media. Posting a photo of her bed head or messy home or whatever else would make Scarlett Johansson much more relatable, which is really what women are looking for. I mean, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>’s brand is VERY sexy, but she’ll also post about wearing two pairs of Spanx under a tight dress. That is why Kim K has a legion of female fans, despite her overt sexuality. If ScarJo did the same, women may warm up to the actress who oozes sexuality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because she doesn't do social media, audiences only see the polished side of ScarJo, be it on the red carpet or in interviews.</p><h2 id=she-s-in-the-media-way-too-much><strong>She's In The Media Way Too Much</strong></h2><p>There’s a popular saying that goes, "No press is bad press." In that regard, being talked about, even if it’s unflattering, is better than not being talk about at all. I would agree with that to some extent, but celebrities should also be aware of being overexposed. By overexposed, I don’t mean accidentally flashing the paparazzi, but that’s something all celebrities should avoid as well. Being overexposed refers to being in the media WAY too much. So, if you will, the way a celebrity is in the media ALL THE TIME before their movie comes out, right? This is normal, because they are promoting their film. But, there are celebrities who are always, always, always in the media, regardless of a film coming out or not. There are celebrities that are always talked about. This is Scarlett Johansson. The media LOVES her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it’s not ScarJo’s fault that the media reports on when she goes out to get milk or to get gas, but it’s kind of annoying, right? You just kind of don't feel like hearing about her at all anymore.</p><h2 id=colin-jost-though><strong>Colin Jost, Though?</strong></h2><p>Listen, I don’t want to tell Scarlett Johansson who she can and can’t hook up with, but she can’t hook up with SNL's Colin Jost. She just can't.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson is considered one of the hottest people in the world, so she should really be hooking up with super hot guys, right? It’s the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>/<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> paradigm. If you’re THAT hot, you should date other people who are that hot. ScarJo is THAT hot, but her dating history is a little bit scattered. She dated Ryan Reynolds, who is super hot so that worked. She also dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Hartnett</a>, who is again really hot. But, she also dated Jack Antonoff… and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Penn</a>… and she hooked up with Colin Jost. I’m just… so confused. Like, ScarJo you can’t go hooking up with average looking dudes because then what are us girls going to do? If Scarlett Johansson is giving these Average Joes the belief they can score with her, the rest of us are doomed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quite frankly, her dating history is overall just something that makes her unappealing. Female audiences want a relationship they can root for, à&nbsp;la <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a>.</p><h2 id=she-s-really-short><strong>She's Really Short</strong></h2><p>Okay, the fact that Scarlett Johansson is only 5’3” doesn’t necessarily make girls dislike her. Plenty of shorter celebrities are loved by women. For example, <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> is 5’3” and women LOVE her. But, Sarah Jessica Parker is lovable not necessarily for her size but for her fashion sense, which men don’t really understand.</p><p>I digress; the point is that men love ScarJo’s body. And, mind you, her body is great. She’s fit and healthy looking. She has curves, but is still thin. By most standards, she has a good body, but it’s also a body that’s pretty achievable. With work outs and a healthy diet, most women can have ScarJo’s body. On the other hand, no amount of working out will give a woman Blake Lively, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner</a>, or <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>’s legs, because all their legs are 100 feet long. Biology and genes play a part in your body – how long your legs are, how wide set your hips are. If you aren't born with Blake Lively's legs, no work out will magically give you them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scarlett Johansson’s body is fantastic, but it’s also achievable. Because of this, it can be off-putting when guys literally drool over her body.</p><h2 id=hollywood-will-cast-her-in-anything><strong>Hollywood Will Cast Her In Anything</strong></h2><p>Hollywood loves casting Scarlett Johansson in just about any movie possible. I mean, after 2014’s Lucy grossed $463.4 million on a budget of just $40 million, Hollywood saw dollar signs. She became $carlett Johan$$on.</p><p>So, ScarJo can open a movie. That’s great, but that doesn’t mean ScarJo should open every single movie in Hollywood. Specifically, ScarJo was cast in Ghost in the Shell, a film based on Japanese source material. Everyone complained about whitewashing, which, yes, it was whitewashing. An Asian actress should have won that part.</p><p>To make matters more awkward, the marketing for Ghost in the Shell was largely just ScarJo running around and looking naked. I'm sure guys didn't mind the trailer for Ghost in the Shell. I'll even admit that it was hot. What's not hot is that they passed on an Asian actress so that Scarlett Johansson's sexuality could sell the movie. I'll pass on that one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-overrated><strong>She's Overrated</strong></h2><p>I think Scarlett Johansson is a very, very beautiful woman. So, when I say she's overrated, I’m not saying she’s not attractive. She's very attractive. But, is she really the Sexiest Woman in the World?</p><p>Scarlett Johansson consistently makes Maxim’s list of the Hot 100. Esquire named her The Sexiest Woman Alive in both 2006 and 2013, making her the first woman to receive the award twice. Playboy named her the Sexiest Celebrity in 2007. In 2010, GQ named her Babe of the Year. So, basically every publication ever has named ScarJo the hottie of all hotties, but that's the problem. As soon as someone is named "the hottest" it makes people turn against them. It’s not that ScarJo isn’t hot, or maybe even the hottest. It’s just that being named "the sexiest" opens you up to criticism. The real issue is that whenever you say someone is the "sexiest in the world" or something of that nature, they immediately become overrated. Because, how can you really say someone is the sexiest in the world, right? Beauty is subjective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=guys-really-really-love-her><strong>Guys Really, Really Love Her</strong></h2><p>Is it just me, or do guys just love Scarlett Johansson, like, a little too much? Calm the hell down, dudes. The fact that guys just DIE over Scarlett Johansson that can turn women off. It's more fun to love the underdog or someone who isn't talked about so often. Since everyone loves ScarJo so much, it doesn’t feel fun to love her. Loving yourself some ScarJo is cliché and obvious.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's that Scarlett Johansson is so present in the media, yet closes herself off from fans in terms of personality that really rubs women the wrong way. To each their own. If she wants to keep a piece of herself out of the public eye, that’s great. But, it doesn’t give female fans a chance to connect with her emotionally or to find her relatable. Guys may like ScarJo and just how unattainable she seems, but that’s not what girls generally look for in a star.
