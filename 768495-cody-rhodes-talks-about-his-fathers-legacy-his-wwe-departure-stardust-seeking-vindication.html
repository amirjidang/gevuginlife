You can read the introduction below:</p><p>Who is Cody Rhodes?</p><p>The person who last asked me that was Vince McMahon, and I stuttered. I was furious with myself for not having a quick response. However, I know now.</p><p>Cody Rhodes is someone with vindication on his mind.</p><p>I didn’t leave WWE to prove them wrong, but it sure as hell feels good when I do. I am seeking vindication. For what, you ask? Maybe I felt Stardust was beneath me. It may be because my dad, and now my brother, deserved better. There is more than one reason, but the end result is that I am seeking vindication and I’m playing to win.</p><p>I’ve had my share of bulls— this year. I am not fully complete as a pro wrestler, and there is a lot for me left to learn, but the only way to learn is to go places in wrestling that no one has gone. I want to cross barriers and run at this like as if wrestling were the territories in the 1970s and 80s—that’s what I am trying to do. People kept telling me it can’t be done, that the business has changed, and I’m sure there were other reasons. But I just stopped listening and started believing.</p><p>Anything can be done, particularly in pro wrestling. There is an element of our business that is financial. I have to thank WWE for providing me with money and equity, but that does not change a thing regarding my plans and dreams. For a time, I had given up on my dream, but the instant I walked away from WWE was the moment I realized I was foolish to think that way.</p><p>My father waxed poetic on hard times. I’ve tasted them, and I kept that taste in my mouth.</p><p>Yes, I am my father’s son.</p><p>to read the full article.</p><p class=authors-note>Take the time to read this. Even if you were never a fan of Cody or Dusty, this gives a lot of perspective into Cody’s feelings about his own career, and his father’s legacy and how to or how not to try and live up to it or repeat it.&nbsp;It’s very moving and personal and insightful, and overall enjoyable to hear someone be this personal about their life and career.</p><p>Relive Goldberg’s RAW return in the debut of Figure 2 Photo!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5Vxa3JtXZi8pcWMq5%2BonJWoerWty6SqZpmSpMK1eceiqmaekam1pr7SZqOen5GYxm60yKxksK%2BVYrGmvMCrq66qlWLAta3RnaysrF2osqa3yKeeZq6Zo7Gqr8CtoKim</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dabbs-greer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-687448-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dabbs Greer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chantelle-navarro-bio-wiki-age-height-family-boyfriend-wftv-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chantelle Navarro Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Boyfriend, WFTV and Net Worth.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
