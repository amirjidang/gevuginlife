It is a decision that the Independence Day actor <a href=#>regrets to this day</a>.</p><p>Nicolas Cage, Brad Pitt and Top Gun star Val Kilmer all passed on the opportunity as well, at a time when the creators of The Matrix were not as distinguished in the industry as they are now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Roles Will Smith Turned Down (And 5 He Was Rejected For)</a></span></p><p>Those four men’s loss eventually became Reeves’ gain, as his performance helped the film to smashing levels of success.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Beirut-born superstar is eternally grateful that Smith and co.’s decision gave him the opportunity to star in the role of a lifetime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keanu-reeves-is-thankful-to-will-smith-for-saying-no-to-lsquo-the-matrix-rsquo>Keanu Reeves Is Thankful To Will Smith For Saying No To ‘The Matrix’</h2><p>In November last year, Keanu Reeves sat for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Esquire</a>, where he answered all manner of questions about his career, as well as his personal life and interests. It was in this conversation that the John Wick star revealed his exact feelings about Will Smith saying no to The Matrix, and effectively handing him the career-defining role of Neo.</p><p>When asked how he felt about it, Reeves said: “Well, it changed my life. And it was such a wonderful creative experience. And so to play Neo in The Matrix trilogy, and now in the fourth, it impacted my life, personally and creatively.” Then, looking straight at the camera – seemingly to address his peer – the actor added: “Thank you very much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Matrix’s success was immediate and emphatic.

I was absolutely taken with it,” he said, while also praising the concept that the Wachowskis were looking to execute.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Matrix 4' Has Drastically Changed Keanu Reeves' Net Worth, Here's How</a></span></p><p>“The construct… the platform that they had of reality and what you perceive of reality from a science fiction aspect, the idea of the agents – and then there was kung-fu thrown in!

Laurence Fishburne was perfect,” Smith said in the video, also praising Reeves’ co-star in the picture. “I probably would have messed The Matrix up. I would have ruined it. So I did y'all a favor.”</p><p>On his part, Reeves was glad that he not only got to star in the original trilogy, but also return for the reboot in 2021. He shared this sentiment in response to a question about what felt the most surreal when reprising the character of Neo all these years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I've never had the chance to play a role, 15, 16, 17 years later,” Reeves said in the Esquire interview. “And that's some of what the film is about.
