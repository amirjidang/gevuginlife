The TV personality joined RHOA in its fifth season, and while fans weren’t too familiar with her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her explosive storyline with her now ex-husband</a>, former NFL star Kordell Stewart, was enough to keep fans glued to their television screens.</p><p>Then, in 2014, after turning physical with fellow cast member Kenya Moore at the Season 6 reunion taping, executive producer <strong>Andy Cohen later confirmed that Williams had been demoted</strong> to being a friend of the show because they do not condone violent behavior as such.</p><p>If you don’t recall, Williams pulled Moore by her hair and dragged her across the floor. It didn’t just look painful, it also sounded painful. Needless to say, being demoted cost the mother of one her place on RHOA, which would have consequently affected her salary, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s claimed that Williams was once worth $16 million (presumably somewhere around the time she was with Stewart?) but <strong>her fortune has dropped to an assumed $500,000</strong> after being fired from the show — so what exactly happened?</p><p><strong>Updated March 2024: </strong>While Porsha Williams' net worth dropped severely after leaving Real Housewives of Atlanta, it has since been on the rise. <strong>Williams' current net worth is $1.5 million</strong>. That figure stands to fluctuate as Williams signed to return to 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' for Season 16. However, she is also going through a divorce, and it is unknown if Williams will stand to financially gain from the demise of her marriage.</p><h2 id=a-look-into-porsha-williams-39-net-worth>A Look Into Porsha Williams' Net Worth</h2><h3 id=portia-williams-has-gone-on-a-roller-coaster-ride-with-her-net-worth>Portia Williams has gone on a roller coaster ride with her net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar47148085-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Williams was demoted from RHOA in 2014, she didn’t just kiss her peach goodbye, she also waved farewell to those lucrative salaries Bravo is known for paying its cast members.</p><p>Kandi Burruss, for example, is estimated to have made around $2 million on the show between 2014 and 2015, while Nene Leakes was reportedly walking away with upwards of $2.5 million per season, making her one of the highest-paid housewives of the franchise.</p><p>In a statement after the ordeal involving Williams, Moore said, "We all agree that we don't condone violence. We’ve become angry with each other, we've threatened each other and gone to the edge. But at the end of the day, we know there's a line.

But then again, aside from her marriage problems with Stewart, the one-time singer didn’t have that many captivating storylines going for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Season 7, Williams would pop in here and there and make recurring guest appearances as a friend to the ladies of the show. It’s unclear how much Williams was making during this time, but it certainly wouldn’t have been anywhere near the money she made while she was a full-time cast member.</p><p>Thankfully, Season 8 saw the line-up switch-up yet again <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as producers welcomed back Williams as a housewife</a> while Claudia Jordan got the boot and was replaced by Hollywood veteran Kim Fields.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-ae-the-financial-issues-with-kim-zolciak-and-kroy-biermann-and-how-did-they-get-themselves-into-so-much-trouble_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Are The Financial Issues With Kim Zolciak And Kroy Biermann And How Did They Get Themselves Into Trouble?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann aren't getting divorced anymore, they are still dealing with a ton of financial problems...</span><p>With the return, Williams' salary was significantly higher <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after being offered a whopping $1.25 million</a> — which was the most Williams had ever earned as a housewife on the show.</p><p>That amount reportedly <strong>increased to $1.3 million</strong>, according to The U.S. Sun, who added that Williams getting her own three-part reality show would earn the Atlanta native a skyrocketing sum of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Williams fronted the TV show on her own, she did not have to share her earnings for Porsha's Family Matters.

This is because Williams is not only going through a divorce from Simon Guobadia, but she also signed to return to RHOA for Season 16. As such, whether Williams' net worth stays in the seven-figures or drops to six, remains to be seen.</p><p>Source: The US Sun</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinqKqjna5uw8ilo6KZnah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqW%2Bzqlkam5doratuMiopWasn2KCcXyMrZ%2BoraOWu6V5w6KtqKqTmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ice-spice-net-worth-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ice Spice Net Worth How Much is Spice Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-do-target-employees-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Do Target Employees Make?
