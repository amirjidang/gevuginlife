She said, "The dinner choices were questionable but got food anyway," which many college students can relate to.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Kate Gosselin Fade Out Of The Spotlight?</a></span></p><p>From Leah's TikTok account, fans can also see that she loves to cook and bake.
