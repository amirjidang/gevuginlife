Of course, that is exactly what the people who run the television networks want since emotionally invested viewers tend to be extremely loyal. Despite that fact, however, there is a long history of <a href=#>shows with loyal fan followings that have been canceled too soon</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Shows Canceled After 1 Season That Deserve Season 2</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that TV shows often seem to get canceled on a whim, it can be extremely frustrating when fans don’t know if their favorite show has been renewed yet. For example, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party fans have been left wondering about the fate of the show which begs an obvious question, has the show been canceled?</p><h2 id=the-truth-about-snoop-dogg-and-martha-stewart-39-s-relationship>The Truth About Snoop Dogg And Martha Stewart's Relationship</h2><p>Throughout entertainment history, there have been endless examples of couples who fit together so perfectly that it almost seems like they were born for each other. For example, powerhouse celebrity couples like Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, as well as Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka seem like perfect pairings. On the other hand, there also have been <a href=#>some celebrity pairings that seem so mismatched that their relationships baffle everyone</a>. For example, people are confused by <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> and Travis Barker, Ashley Olsen and Lance Armstrong, as well as Pete Davidson and every star he has dated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everyone Pete Davidson Has Been Romantically Linked To</a></span></p><p>On top of the fact that some celebrity romantic relationships make no sense, many stars are close even though people would never expect them to be friends. For example, when people learned that Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg were friends, it seemed like someone put a bunch of names on a board and threw darts at it with their eyes closed. As it turns out, however, the real origin of Snoop and Martha’s friendship is very simple and sweet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Snoop Dogg's Relationship With Martha Stewart</a></span></p><p>In the years since the world learned that Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart are pals, the two stars have both been asked how they became friends several times. As a result, it is known that in 2008, Martha asked Snoop to appear on The Martha Stewart Show because she thought viewers would enjoy seeing two stars with very different images together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Snoop Dogg appeared on The Martha Stewart Show, he connected with the show’s titular host while they made delicious mashed potatoes together. The reason for that is that on top of making food together, Snoop and Martha seemed to have a lot of fun making each other laugh during his appearance on her show. In the years since that appearance, Snoop has also remarked that he feels that Martha opened the door for rappers like him to appear on daytime television when she welcomed him to her show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how much they seemed to enjoy cooking together on television that didn’t inherently mean that Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart would become friends. However, both of them have expressed how close their bond is away from television since then. For example, Snoop once spoke about the influence that Martha has had on him. “Martha’s like the big sister I never had – she’s able to correct me, to teach me, to show me how to be better, and to give me something to aspire to be. We all need that in life.” After reading that quote, it seems clear that everyone would be better off if they had a bond like the one that Snoop and Martha share with someone in their life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-martha-stewart-amp-snoop-dogg-39-s-potluck-dinner-party-is-unclear-but-looking-promising>Did Martha Stewart & Snoop Dogg's Potluck Dinner Party Is Unclear But Looking Promising</h2><p>Each year, a lot of people wait with bated breath as the networks begin to announce which shows have been renewed since they want to make sure their favorite show hasn’t been canceled. In a lot of cases, it doesn’t take long for that information to be released as the major networks often seem eager to tell the world about the fate of their programming. On the other hand, some networks seem to think it is a better idea to keep fans wondering including VH1.</p><p>Since Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party airs on VH1, it is one of the shows whose fate has yet to be confirmed, unfortunately. With that in mind and the fact that Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party’s third season finale aired in February of 2020, it makes sense that some people assume the show is over.</p><p>Despite the understandable pessimism that some people feel about Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party’s future, there aren’t any reports that the show is officially canceled. On top of that, while it doesn’t seem good that it has been two years since a new episode last aired, a lot of shows have taken a longer break than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the internet, several websites solely focus on whether shows have been renewed or canceled. According to one of those websites, release-date.info, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party’s future is still a mystery</a>. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nextseasontv.com reports that Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party has been renewed for a fourth season</a>. While the only way that nextseasontv.com’s report will be confirmed is if VH1 puts out a statement or new episodes begin airing, there is one main reason to take it seriously. Since people turn to the website nextseasontv.com because it has been credible, its entire business model would be destroyed if it suddenly began reporting wrong information. That doesn’t necessarily mean that nextseasontv.com is right that Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party has been renewed but it is reason to be optimistic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What's Going On Between Snoop Dogg And Martha Stewart?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLuwu89mm6ifl2Kur7CMppirrJiWerTAxLCYq6xdqLWww4ygnK1lk5a7pLHLnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-phil-dunster-have-a-wife-everything-to-know-about-his-dating-history-290120-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Phil Dunster Have A Wife?
