After starting her music career on the country scene, she made a successful leap to pop music with her "1989" album. Over the years, she has won countless awards and gained millions of fans around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was shortly after the release of "1989" that Swift began dating Calvin Harris. The two were very public with their relationship, only to have a very public breakup soon afterward.</p><p>While there was much speculation over the reason for their breakup, many believe it has to do with one of Harris' hit songs. It was later revealed <a href=#>he just so happened to write the song in question with Swift</a>.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-calvin-harris-go-instagram-official-with-a-photo-of-her-cats>Taylor Swift And Calvin Harris Go Instagram Official With A Photo Of Her Cats</h2><p><a href=#>Swift and Harris first met at the 2015 Elle Style Awards</a> in February. According to an Instagram post, Ellie Goulding introduced the two. The picture, snapped by user corbell.makes.music, shows Goulding and Swift joining Harris outside the elevator. Sam Smith was also in the picture with Harris.</p><p>Later that month, it was reported the two flirted with each other the entire night at the Brit Awards. In March, they were snapped by the paparazzi going to Whole Foods wearing matching outfits. A month later, the two wore matching outfits again to a Hiam show at the Troubador in West Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The moment the couple went Instagram official was on April 28, when Harris posed a photo of Swift's cats, Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey, on his account. Later that May, the couple made their first public appearance together at the Billboard Music Awards, where there was a lot of PDA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar44981910.jpg><p>For the next several months, the two were spotted together seemingly enjoying their time together. However, breakup rumors were never far away from them. In October, these rumors were shut down on Twitter by both Swift's publicist and Harris himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2016, Harris posted a photo of Swift collecting a Grammy to his Instagram and referred to her as his "beautiful girlfriend" in the caption. On March 6, Harris bought Swift a locket engraved with the date their relationship began.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Taylor Swift's Cats Have A Higher Net Worth Than Her Ex-Boyfriends?

The two were said to have had a dance-off at that year's Met Gala. This sparked rumors of a split with Harris and it was eventually confirmed that June.</p><p>"The only truth is that a relationship came to an end & what remains is a huge amount of love and respect," Harris tweeted, with Swift retweeting the post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later that month, The Sun published photographs of Swift kissing Hiddleston at her home in Rhode Island. In July, Harris released a breakup song titled "Ol√©," which many believed was about his relationship with Swift.</p><p>"I see online that you've begun to be a good girl and take trips with your boyfriend, being attentive / Continue to pretend," read some of the lyrics, which many thought were about Swift's relationship with Hiddleston.</p><p>It was later revealed that the breakup may have been over a song Harris and Swift wrote called "This Is What You Came For." The song would feature vocals by Rihanna and Swift's songwriting credits were initially included under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Calvin Harris Poses Shirtless On Instagram To Promote New Album</a></span></p><p>The song was released earlier that April, but Swift's representative confirmed her involvement that July. She was said to have been upset when Harris told Ryan Seacrest that he didn't consider working with his then-girlfriend a possibility.</p><p>"You know, we haven't even spoken about it. I can't see it happening, though," he said on Seacrest's radio show. Harris explained that Swift was about to take "a long break," citing that as his reason for the impossibility.</p><h2 id=calvin-harris-called-out-taylor-swift-on-twitter-and-later-said-that-he-was-wrong-to-do-so>Calvin Harris Called Out Taylor Swift On Twitter And Later Said That He Was Wrong To Do So</h2><p>Harris responded to the report with a series of since-deleted tweets. He praised Swift's talent as a lyric writer and said she "smashed it as usual." Harris confirmed that Swift wanted to keep her involvement a secret. He also said it was "hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage, though."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do," Harris wrote. "I know you're off tour, and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC, but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar44983265.jpg><p><a href=#>Harris later spoke to British GQ</a> that October and talked about his Twitter rant.</p><p>"Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure. It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was completely the wrong instinct," Harris said. "I was protecting what I see as my one talent in the world being belittled. It felt like things were piling on top of me, and that was when I snapped."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Went Wrong?
