Lucrative <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsorship deals with major brands also provide a significant income stream</a>. While darts players were once working-class men playing in their local pubs, the multimillionaires emerging today live a life of luxury. The top stars enjoy the fruits of their labor through big houses, expensive cars, and traveling the world while playing a game they love. Here is a closer look at the ten wealthiest darts players based on their career tournament winnings and estimated endorsement deals.</p><h2 id=martin-adams-1-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Martin Adams: $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Martin Adams, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">better known by his nickname Wolfie</a>, built his fortune as one of the most successful players in the British Darts Organization (BDO). With over 70 professional titles, including three BDO World Championships, Adams established himself as a legend in the BDO circuit. Though he never made the switch to the more lucrative Professional Darts Corporation, Wolfie's long career still allowed him to accrue over $1 million in earnings before retiring in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Richest Boxers In The World, As Of 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=glen-durrant-1-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Glen Durrant: $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The three-time BDO World Champion switched to the PDC in 2019 and quickly rose in the rankings. Durrant is already making his mark on the richest darts players lists and should see his net worth grow substantially if he can win a PDC major. Durrant has participated in major PDC tournaments, including the PDC World Darts Championship and the Premier League. His performances in these events have been spectacular, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and he is destined for greatness.</a></p><h2 id=dennis-priestley-1-5-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dennis Priestley: $1.5 million</span></h2><p>Dennis Priestley was one of the first true superstars of professional darts, helping globalize the sport in the 1990s.
