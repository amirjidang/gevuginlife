For Miley, Jessie co-wrote the chart-topping hit, 'Party In The USA,' which she said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid her rent for three years</a>.</p><p>Her net worth stands at $30 million, but how did she amass such a big fortune in such a short amount of time? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 id=she-co-wrote-miley-cyrus-party-in-the-usa><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Co-Wrote Miley Cyrus' 'Party In The USA'</span></h2><p>Many people don’t know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a>’ 2009 hit, ‘Party In The USA’, was co-written by Jessie J, way before she became a household name. To date, the song has sold over 7 million copies in the USA, so it’s fair to assume that Jessie got paid quite a bit for co-writing that big hit.</p><h2 id=she-signed-a-lucrative-deal-to-become-a-judge-on-the-voice-uk><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Signed A Lucrative Deal To Become A Judge On 'The Voice UK'...</span></h2><p>When Jessie J signed on to become a judge on The Voice UK in 2012, she was reportedly paid an estimated $250,000 per season - the ‘Domino’ singer would go on to appear on two seasons of the show, before she decided to leave. She left to focus on her next album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-later-signed-up-for-the-voice-australia><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>... And Later Signed Up For 'The Voice Australia'</span></h2><p>Jessie ended up signing on for another run of the popular talent show, but this time, she was honing her judging skills on the Australian edition of The Voice. It’s unclear how much she made working in the Land Down Under, but it’s fair to assume that those numbers were probably similar to what she had earned on The Voice in the UK.</p><h2 id=her-debut-album-was-a-commercial-success><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Her Debut Album Was A Commercial Success</span></h2><p>Jessie J’s debut album, ‘Who You Are’, was an enormous - and unexpected - commercial success, spawning hits not only in the UK but also in the USA. Her single, ‘Domino,’ peaked at no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went on to sell over five million copies worldwide. The album, which is primarily filled with songs written by Jessie, went on to sell over six million copies worldwide.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessie J Shows Some Love On Her Ex’s Birthday- A Third Shot For The Pair?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-album-spawned-numerous-hits><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Album Spawned Numerous Hits</span></h2><p>Aside from ‘Domino,’ Jessie continued to dominate the charts with songs such as ‘Do It Like a Dude,’ the B.O.B-assisted ‘Price Tag,’ ‘Nobody’s Perfect,’ and ‘Who You Are.’ Again, Jessie holds songwriting credits on all of these songs, so there’s no doubt that she would have made plenty of money just from these tracks alone.</p><h2 id=she-gets-paid-to-post-on-social-media><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Gets Paid To Post On Social Media</span></h2><p>As we’re all aware at this point, celebrities get paid to post sponsored content on their social media platforms, which can be anything from weight loss products to food supplements. It’s believed that with her 9.2 million followers, Jessie J could easily charge up to $50,000 for a sponsored post.</p><h2 id=she-won-a-major-talent-show-in-china><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Won A Major Talent Show In China</span></h2><p>In April 2018, Jessie J went on to win a major Chinese talent show called ‘Singer.’ She won the contest after getting an incredible 48% of the public vote. The competition is watched by over 100 million people in China, so it gave Jessie an enormous amount of exposure. Jessie is definitely an international pop icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Pics That’ll Have Jessie J Miss Channing Now That They’ve Split (Again)</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-predicted-to-earn-millions-for-her-win><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Was Predicted To Earn Millions For Her Win</span></h2><p>Following her ‘Singer' win, in-the-know experts believed that Jessie J could earn millions through business deals in Asia. In fact, there was talk that she could potentially walk away with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million</a>. It’s unclear whether Jessie has engaged in any business work in Asia, or whether she's even been back to China since winning the show, but apparently she does have the option of making serious money there.</p><h2 id=she-s-helmed-major-endorsement-deals-in-her-career><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She’s Helmed Major Endorsement Deals In Her Career</span></h2><p>Endorsement deals are another great way for celebrities to rake in the big bucks and increase their net worth - especially if a deal is struck with a major company, like Nike, who partnered with Jessie J in 2013. She had her very own sportswear campaign with the firm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-sold-over-20-million-singles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She’s Sold Over 20 Million Singles</span></h2><p>Since the release of her debut album, ‘Who You Are’, in 2011, Jessie J has sold an impressive 20 million singles, which is a major feat for someone who didn’t even expect to receive so much recognition because of her songs. Some of her biggest hits to date include ‘Price Tag,’ ‘Bang Bang,’ and ‘Do It Like A Dude.’</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind Channing Tatum And Jessie J’s Split</a></span></p><h2 id=she-starred-in-the-tv-musical-grease-live><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Starred In The TV Musical ‘Grease: Live’</span></h2><p>In 2016, Jessie J showed off her vocal abilities when she starred in FOX’s Grease: Live, which starred a handful of famous celebrities, including Julianne Hough, Keke Palmer, Vanessa Hudgens, and Carly Rae Jepsen. There’s no doubt that Jessie J would have received a nice salary for her work on the show, which had an impressive 12.2 million viewers.</p><h2 id=she-was-also-a-judge-on-the-voice-kids-uk><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Was Also A Judge On ‘The Voice Kids UK’</span></h2><p>Over the summer of 2019, it was revealed that Jessie J was returning to The Voice UK - but this time, she would be lending her judging talents to the kids' edition, titled The Voice Kids. She only returned for one series, but if her salary was anything similar to the $200,000 she earned previously, Jessie would have made plenty of money from that gig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-in-a-high-profile-relationship-with-channing-tatum><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She’s In A High-Profile Relationship With Channing Tatum</span></h2><p>One could argue that being in a high-profile relationship is a profitable move. It’s not uncommon for celebs to date one another for the sake of publicity, particularly if they have projects coming out that benefit from free publicity. Jessie J and Channing Tatum have been dating since 2018, and whether or not it has helped their careers is arguable, but their relationship certainly gets a lot of media attention.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Jessie J That’ll Make Channing Tatum Miss Her</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujnrJutoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMbGdmpZmhuaq7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-chrest-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-430371-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Chrest Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-belen-cuesta-transgender-in-real-life-meet-the-actress-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Belen Cuesta Transgender In Real Life?
