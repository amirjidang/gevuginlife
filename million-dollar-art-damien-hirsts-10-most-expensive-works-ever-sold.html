His popularity only soared from that point in his life. He is best known for his installations that feature preserved deal animals displayed in clear cases and pharmaceutical themes showcasing pill cabinets. <a href=#>He is also recognized for his ‘spin’ and ‘spot’ paintings over the years</a>. Hirst is one of the most commercially successful artists and once made history for selling the most expensive artwork ever.</p><p>Hirst’s most expensive works range between paintings, cabinets and formaldehyde-preserved animals. His sold-out installations have amassed him a $700 million net worth until now. Let’s take a look at Damien Hirst’s most expensive works sold to date.</p><h2 id=memories-of-moments-with-you>Memories Of/ Moments With You</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first on the list is Damien Hirst’s 2008 work called Memories Of/Moments With You. It was made from stainless steel, gold, and cubic zirconia. The work was displayed at various auctions, most of which occurred at Tate Modern. Hirst had made the bold decision to take all of his artworks straight to auctions rather than galleries and dealers who earn commissions. Memories Of/Moments With You was auctioned at Sotheby’s London and sold for $4.13 million, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide Walls</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Salvador Dali's 7 Most Expensive Paintings</a></span></p><h2 id=away-from-the-flock>Away From The Flock</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Created in 1994, Away From The Flock is the first work of Damien Hirst made using formaldehyde. The lamb sculpture inside a clear glass was sold at Christie’s during the Post-War And Contemporary Art Evening Sale in 2018. The work was purchased in 30 seconds after <a href=#>the bidding began for $4.41 million</a>. Hirst had made four editions of the Flock, and the others are displayed at The Broad and Tate Britain.</p><h2 id=here-today-gone-tomorrow>Here Today, Gone Tomorrow</h2><p>Hirst’s installation called Here Today, Gone Tomorrow is as beautiful as it is complex. The work is made from stainless steel, glass, acrylic, MDF, fish, fish skeletons, and formaldehyde solution. Here Today, Gone Tomorrow was created in 2008 and sold the same year at Sotheby’s London for $4.67 million.</p><h2 id=the-void>The Void</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Void was executed in 2000 and the largest and the first-ever pill cabinet created by Hirst. It was also the first cabinet work shown at an exhibition. The structure features mirrored back, sliding glass doors, sterilized steel casing, and hand-made and painted pills lined with precision. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Art-Net News</a>, the artwork was sold at Phillips New York for $5.85 million.</p><h2 id=where-there-s-a-will-there-s-a-way>Where There’s A Will, There’s A Way</h2><p>The following artwork on the list also features a pill cabinet and is a beautiful artwork created in 2007. The cabinet features antiretroviral pills that are consumed to treat HIV/AIDS. The entire artwork is filled with those pills in sterilized steel casing and sliding glass doors. The piece was auctioned at Sotheby’s New York and <a href=#>sold for $6.5 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lullaby-winter>Lullaby Winter</h2><p>A glimpse into the concepts of life, death, and the human condition, Hirst’s Lullaby Winter features thousands of hand-crafted pills displayed on clear shelves and shiny steel cases. The number of shelved pills denote the number of pills a human consumes in a lifetime. The display questions mortality and how medicines influence people’s lives. The piece was sold at Sotheby’s New York for $6.6 million.</p><h2 id=eternity>Eternity</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kaleidoscope has always inspired Hirst to<a href=#> create his artwork</a>. One of his early works was a Kaleidoscope series, which featured butterfly-winged paintings on a 17-feet wide canvas that contained 2,700 butterflies. It highlighted Hirst’s interest in the blurring lines between life and death. Eternity was a part of the same series and sold at Phillips in London for $6.6 million, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Art Broker</a>.</p><h2 id=the-kingdom>The Kingdom</h2><p>The Kingdom is one of Hirst’s most famous sculptures that features a tiger shark in a clear glass cabinet. Created in 2008, the piece was sold during the same year at a Sotheby’s auction for $15.3 million. The excess media attention on the selling price made Hirst comment that art cannot be contained by money, and it is essential to appreciate the efforts taken to make the piece.</p><h2 id=the-golden-calf>The Golden Calf</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sold at the controversial Sotheby’s auction in 2008, the sculpture features a white bullock preserved in formaldehyde. The hoofs and horns on the bullock are made from 18-carat gold and a gold disc on top of the head. <a href=#>The artwork drew three bidders</a> before it was sold for $16.5 million.</p><h2 id=lullaby-spring>Lullaby Spring</h2><p>Part of the cabinet series, Lullaby Spring displays the Spring season with the hand-crafted pills located with precision. The bright-colored tablets symbolize new beginnings like the Spring and the celebration of a renewed life. The artwork was sold at Sotheby’s auction in 2007 for $19.3 million, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Art Magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>While art is invaluable</a>, the insightful artworks by Damien Hirst have been sought-after pieces. Shedding light on human life and mortality, the artist presents questions bigger than his works. Hirst was recently in the spotlight for inspiring musician Drake’s newest album, Certified Lover Boy’s album cover featuring a series of emojis of pregnant women wearing different colors of clothes, similar to his infamous pill cabinets.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Picasso's 10 Most Expensive Paintings</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide Walls</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Art-Net News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Art Broker</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Art Magazine</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qrjLoqanZZSkua2t0WaYq6xdma6utcSnZKGhoqjBtHmQaWSmp6OpeqbEz56lrKGmmnq4u9Gkqmadppq%2Fbr%2FOpZto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-cabral-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Danielle Cabral Net Worth How Much Is Danielle Cabral Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-aguilera-is-engaged-to-boyfriend-matt-rutler-2014142.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Aguilera Engaged to Boyfriend Matt Rutler!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
