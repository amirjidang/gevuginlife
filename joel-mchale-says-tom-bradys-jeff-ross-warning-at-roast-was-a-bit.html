In the place, it [seemed like] a joke.”</p><p class=p1>Brady, 46, starred in the live Netflix special on Sunday, May 5, where comedian Ross, 58, attempted to make a joke about New England Patriots owner <strong>Robert Kraft</strong>. (Brady spent much of his NFL career as a quarterback for the team.)</p><p class=p1>“‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made,’” Ross said, impersonating Brady. “‘Would you like a massage?’” (Kraft, 82, was charged in 2019 for soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor. He was ultimately cleared of all charges.)</p><p class=p1>Brady, however,<a href=#> appeared to be bothered</a> by the subtle dig and walked up to the podium to stage-whisper in Ross’ ear.</p><p class=p1>“Don’t say that s—t again,” Brady told Ross, who then replied, “OK, OK. [Robert is] having fun, look at him.”</p><p class=p1>As the roast aired, many viewers theorized that there was real beef between Brady and Ross.</p><p class=p1>“They want there to be something so bad,” McHale quipped on Thursday. “They want to point out, ‘That person said that thing.’ But [Tom] even killed it. He was very smooth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Joel-McHale-Says-Tom-Brady-s-Jeff-Ross-Warning-at-Roast-Was-A-Bit-inline.jpg><p class=p1>Ross, for his part, had reportedly been concerned about how Brady would take his jokes.</p><p class=p1>“Afterward, he was a little like … he was a little bit worried,” <strong>Nikki Glaser</strong>, who also performed on the roast, later <a href=#>recalled on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i></a>. “We have consciences about these things. You know, afterward, we go, ‘Did that really hurt his feelings?’ And I go, ‘You know, [Tom] had to do it performatively for Robert, I’m sure.’ But I’m sure it was not an issue that Jeff was going to hear about today or anything like that.”</p><p class=p1><strong>Kevin Hart</strong> emceed the roast on Sunday, enlisting everyone from Ross, Glaser and more to joke about Brady’s NFL career and retirement, as well <a href=#>as his 2022 divorce</a> from <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t know how big of a deal it was. I didn’t realize we’d be sitting at tables,” McHale recalled. “I brought my 16-year-old [son], so I was like, ‘You enjoying these dirty jokes, son?’ They showed him [on camera] once because his friends [saw him]. He’s a huge football fan, so he knew all the [athletes there]. It was f—king good and I really enjoyed it, and the joke-telling was pretty great.”</p><p class=p1>He continued, “They’re pros, so they should be crushing it, but then the football players got up there. Drew Bledsoe, he nailed it. Overall, it’s a hard thing to do and it was live. [It was] so seamless.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><i>The Roast of Tom Brady </i>is now streaming on Netflix.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGonZxiuqS0wKWcZquRrsBuwM6mZJuqkZnGtHnJnp2fZaKkwLR51pqpp6GenHqiwIyrppqrpGLEor%2BMmmSboaRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenzo-lee-hounsou-age-wiki-biography-height-instagram-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenzo Lee Hounsou Age, Wiki, Biography, Height, Instagram, Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-biden-taylor-swift-plane-ticketmaster-fees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Biden Is Attempting To Get On Taylor Swift And The Swifties' Good Side With These Two Acts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
