She’s a singer, a television judge, an actress, and a pop icon. Indeed, Lopez has come a long way since her childhood years in The Bronx, New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 1990, Lopez earned a national competition and was cast as a Fly Girl for the series In Living Color. A few years later, she also appeared in films such as My Family and Money Train. However, it was the biographical film, Selena, that shot her to superstardom.</p><p>Since then, Lopez has made (and performed) music, starred in films and even served as a judge and mentor on talent shows. As she took on more projects, Lopez’s circle of friends (and enemies) expanded. Just take a look at her celeb friends now, along with five people she’d most likely avoid:</p><h2 id=friends-with-kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Friends With: Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Alex Rodriguez, Lopez’s fiancé, revealed, “We’ve all known each other for a long time…but Kim and Jennifer are very, very close, and she’s almost like a mentee of Jennifer, and Jennifer’s mentored her a lot over the years.” Later on, he also remarked, “To see how much Kim and Jen like each other, respect each other, support each other is awesome.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-with-sean-penn><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Friends With: Sean Penn</span></h2><p>Lopez appeared with the actor in the film, U-Turn. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movieline</a>, Lopez said that they “got along great.” She also recalled, “I was engaged when we were shooting U-Turn, and one day he said, 'If I weren't married and you weren't engaged, would this have been a very different movie?' And I go, 'Yeah! Very different.' So we kind of...well, we both had our own lives, so that made a real difference.”</p><h2 id=avoids-gwyneth-paltrow><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Avoids: Gwyneth Paltrow</span></h2><p>Lopez didn’t seem to care about dissing the actress at one point. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movieline</a>, “Tell me what she's been in? I swear to God, I don't remember anything she was in. Some people get hot by association. I heard more about her and Brad Pitt than I ever heard about her work.”</p><h2 id=friends-with-victoria-beckham><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Friends With: Victoria Beckham</span></h2><p>Lopez once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;The Mail on Sunday, “She’s my friend, because she can make me laugh so hard. OK, so she’s very beautiful and very stylish and her husband is wonderful. But to me the reason I like Victoria is because she’s very funny. She really knows how to make people laugh. And she doesn’t take herself so seriously. She’s a very fun girl.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Little Known Facts About Jennifer Lopez’s Time On American Idol</a></span></p><h2 id=friends-with-tom-cruise><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Friends With: Tom Cruise</span></h2><p>The two once shared the stage together at the MTV Movie Awards and Lopez told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Hollywood</a>, “It was so fun working with him, Tom is a riot. He’s so positive, he’s such an amazing artist.” She added, “He had a lot to learn for that and it was hard for him, but he was always with a big smile on his face. He’s just an amazing person, he really is one of the most special people that you could ever meet and it was an honor for me to work with him.”</p><h2 id=avoids-winona-ryder><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Avoids: Winona Ryder</span></h2><p>Lopez once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made it clear</a>, “I was never a big fan of hers. In Hollywood she's revered, she gets nominated for Oscars, but I've never heard anyone in the public or among my friends say, 'Oh, I love her.' She's cute and talented, though, and I'd like her just for looking like my older sister, Leslie.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-with-kerry-washington><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Friends With: Kerry Washington</span></h2><p>The women already knew each other before either one got famous. In fact, Lopez was once Washington’s dance teacher. While speaking with Jimmy Fallon, Washington <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalled</a>, “I had this very inspiring teacher named Larry Maldonado… he was our role model. And he had an awesome substitute teacher named Jennifer, who would sometimes step in and teach. But then she left to move to LA and be on In Living Color.”</p><p>She later confirmed, “I learned to dance from J.Lo! So that explains everything. That's why I'm a really good dancer.”</p><h2 id=friends-with-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Friends With: Meghan Markle And Prince Harry</span></h2><p>Lopez and Rodriguez recently hung out with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex during an event in Miami’s South Beach. One witness told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, “Harry and Meghan got on really well with Jennifer and Alex, and spent some time chatting with them over dinner. J-Lo was overheard inviting the couple and their baby Archie to her and Alex’s house in Miami to spend time with them and their kids.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears And Jennifer Lopez Post Epic Videos</a></span></p><h2 id=avoids-madonna><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Avoids: Madonna</span></h2><p>During her earlier years in the entertainment industry, Lopez revealed her real impression of the music legend,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “Do I think she's a great performer? Yeah. Do I think she's a great actress? No. Acting is what I do, so I'm harder on people when they say, 'Oh, I can do that--I can act.' I'm like, 'Hey, don't spit on my craft.’”</p><h2 id=friends-with-melissa-mccarthy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Friends With: Melissa McCarthy</span></h2><p>While attending Ellen DeGeneres’s 60th birthday bash, the two actresses even had a dance-off. While speaking on TODAY, McCarthy recalled, “I love dancing so much! I’m like, ‘I got one shot. I got one shot with this one.’ But I’ve done it before, which is terrible. And I literally lose my mind and I’m like, ‘If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I am dancing with Jennifer Lopez tonight.”</p><p>Lopez also remarked, “We had the best time, honestly, and then she just took me around the whole party and knocked people down.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-with-gwen-stefani><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Friends With: Gwen Stefani</span></h2><p>Following her Vegas residency debut, Stefani told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, “We are the same age, and we just kind of went through our lives and we had kids the same time and, like, I ended up buying the house that she had. I live in her house that she put that marble in. Thank you, Jennifer. And then now I'm in her dressing room. So, I love her so much.”</p><h2 id=avoids-salma-hayek><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Avoids: Salma Hayek</span></h2><p>It turns out Latina women don’t always get along. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movieline</a>, “We're in two different realms. She's a sexy bombshell and those are the kinds of roles she does. I do all kinds of different things. It makes me laugh when she says she got offered Selena, which was an outright lie. If that's what she does to get herself publicity, then that's her thing. Columbia offered me the choice of Fools Rush In or Anaconda, but I chose the fun B-movie because the Fools script wasn't strong enough.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez And Alex Rodriguez Take On TikTok With Their Kids!</a></span></p><h2 id=friends-with-leah-remini><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Friends With: Leah Remini</span></h2><p>The two women were introduced to each other by none other than Lopez’s ex-husband, Marc Anthony. While appearing on The View, Remini <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said </a>that she and Lopez are “very close like sisters are and also in a different way than sisters are.” Lopez also explained, “I’m so close with my sisters and so is Leah, but we have similar lives, we have similar careers and kinda nuances that other people don’t understand and so that also bonded us.”</p><h2 id=friends-with-marc-anthony><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Friends With: Marc Anthony</span></h2><p>It’s really great when exes get to be good friends. In the case of Lopez and Anthony, they also still remain a tight family unit as they continue to raise their children together. While appearing on Live with Kelly, Lopez also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remarked</a>, “I think we’re really good the way we are. Honestly, we’re always gonna be great friends…We share something very special in the kids, and we know that. We’re there for them. That’s the main thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avoids-mariah-carey><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Avoids: Mariah Carey</span></h2><p>Carey famously dissed Lopez by repeatedly saying she didn't know her. In fact, when TMZ asked her at an airport in 2016, Carey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remarked</a>, “I still don’t know her.” And when Andy Cohen asked her again, Carey just said, “I don’t know her. Like what am I supposed to say.”</p><p>Meanwhile, while on The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez addressed the issue,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “She does say that. She's forgetful I guess! We've met many times. I don't know...I don't know her that well.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind How Jennifer Lopez Became Famous</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtJmoZ6mnp6zpr6MpaapnapitrR5xaugnqaUqHq4tdOhZG5lo52ybq3VqKCdq12WwW6ty6VknKejqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hollywood-a-listers-animated-films-voiceovers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 Hollywood A-Listers who Earned Big Paychecks for Animated Films</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-semifinals-end-with-shocking-twist.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Dancing With the Stars' Semifinals End With Shocking Twist</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
