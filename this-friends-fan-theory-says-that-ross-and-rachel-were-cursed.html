It's always a great time to watch another episode of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>,</strong> and the debate about the characters taking a break from each other still rages on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Joey dated</a>, fans always knew that Ross and Rachel would be one of the couples left standing by the series finale. Viewers thought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel could be self-centered</a>&nbsp;but it was hard not to root for this couple.</p><p>There are some&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;fan theories that explain a lot about the popular sitcom. Could a theory that Ross and Rachel were cursed be true? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-first-episode-s-curse>The First Episode's Curse</h2><p>There are countless episodes of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;that fans love thinking about. One of them was when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the gang learned about Monica and Chandler's romance</a>. Another one was the very first episode.</p><p>The pilot of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;sets up quite a lot. Viewers learn about Ross and Monica's high school friend Rachel and how her life has become a mess since she decided not to go through with her wedding day. Now Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are going to hang out all the time, and Rachel's inclusion in the group will have a powerful impact on everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ross-Rachel-Friends.jpg><p>A fan posted on&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross opened an umbrella in the </a>pilot that&nbsp;and this led to a curse. They wrote, "When Ross is in the coffee shop meeting Rachel, his umbrella opens up unexpectedly, inside; this begins a 7-year bad luck streak with Rachel. Once the curse is lifted, Rachel tells Ross that he's going to be a father."</p><p>Some fans of the show were happy to hear this theory. One shared, "I love this" and another&nbsp;said it was a "favorite fan theory."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is definitely interesting to think about. Ross and Rachel do have quite a lot of awful luck over the years. While it's true that all TV couples go through obstacles and conflict, whether on a sitcom or drama, these two seem to have more than their fair share of problems. They love each other so much but their romance is plagued with issues and it's not easy for them to just decide to be together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Fan Theory Suggests Jennifer Aniston Left Brad Pitt, Not The Other Way Around</a></span></p><h2 id=other-ross-and-rachel-theories>Other Ross And Rachel Theories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rachel-Friends-Pilot.jpg><p>There are some other fan theories about Friends&nbsp;that explain Ross and Rachel's behavior.</p><p>Another fan theory from a thread on&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;that suggests that Ross assumed he and Rachel could date other people while on a break because that's what he and his ex Carol did back when they were in college. The fan said that he didn't realize that Rachel would find this upsetting, as he and Carol wanted to date others and think more carefully about whether they were meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A third fan theory about Ross suggests that he didn't have custody of his son, Ben, any longer. The fan wrote on Reddit, "Friends was on for ten seasons, but Ben doesn’t show up in person after episode twelve of season eight. He’s only mentioned six times in the remaining fifty-four episodes after his last appearance." The fan also made a good point: even though Ross and Rachel had their baby girl Emma, Emma and Ben didn't meet each other on the show. This definitely seems like something that would have happened.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How David Schwimmer Helped The Cast Of 'Friends' Earn More Money</a></span></p><h2 id=what-the-actors-think>What The Actors Think</h2><p>While fans won't ever know if this theory about Ross and Rachel having a curse put on them is really true, it's fun to learn what David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston thought about their fictional characters who were so in love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2020, Schwimmer said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross and Rachel were on a break</a>.

They were on a break."</p><p>While Schwimmer has shared his feeling on that important question, Aniston has talked about the status of Ross and Rachel's relationship after the series ended... and, naturally, she joked about the same thing.</p><p>According to&nbsp;NME.com, Aniston posted a photo with her fellow&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;actors on Instagram and a fan asked "did Ross and Rachel stay together?"
