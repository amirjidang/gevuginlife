This much was made clear when the actress came on her wife’s show to explain her decision a bit more.</p><p>“I was approaching 45 and I just kind of … was wondering is there something that I could tackle now that I’ve never done before that would be really challenging and different,” de Rossi said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>“I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10, 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That business was revealed to be General Public, an art company that has a partnership with Synographs™, a textured printing process that was developed in partnership with Fujifilm.</p><p>General Public is inspired by the idea that good art needs to become more accessible to everyone (hence the name).</p><p>“As a lifelong art lover and collector, I recognized the gap in terms of quality and price between works shown through a gallery and works that are readily available,” de Rossi told Architectural Digest.</p><p>Portia explained she was interested in making art come to life. “Until now, technology has not enabled painters to re-create paintings with all the dimension and texture of the original,” she explained. “I set about to work with technology companies to develop new technology to make a textured print.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-happened-to-portia-de-rossi-rsquo-s-net-worth-now>Here’s What Happened To Portia De Rossi’s Net Worth Now</h2><p>In 2021, estimates report that de Rossi’s net worth is now as much as $60 million. It seems that her decision to quit acting and grow a company has paid off immensely.</p><p>At the moment, it is unclear how much the former actress’ new business venture has contributed to her wealth. Nonetheless, it’s safe to say that business has been quite good.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the Hollywood side of things, it is likely that de Rossi will receive residual earnings should shows she’s starred in become syndicated in the future.</p><p>So as it seems the former actress’ wealth will just keep growing even if she never takes another role again.
