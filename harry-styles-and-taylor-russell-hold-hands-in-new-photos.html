Each holding coffee cups in one hand, Styles and Russell, both 29, used their free arms to walk hand-in-hand while strolling through the city.</p><p>The pair embraced the fall weather in <a href=#>cozy ensembles</a> as Styles sported a gray hoodie underneath a black puffer jacket. His look was complete with a pair of black pants, sunglasses, sneakers and a blue baseball cap. Russell, for her part, sported an oversized orange jacket and loose-fitting jeans. She accessorized her outfit with a black shoulder bag, hoop earrings and sunglasses.</p><p>Styles and Russell’s cute coffee date comes three months after they first sparked romance rumors while hanging out in London. Russell added fuel to the relationship fire the following month by attending the “As It Was” singer’s <a href=#>concert in Vienna, Austria</a>, as well as his <a href=#>final “Love on Tour” performance</a> in Italy.</p><p>In August, a source exclusively confirmed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the couple had been “dating for a few months,” adding, “Their energies work really well together. They’re both really sweet people at their core.”</p><p>While the connection was “still new,” the insider noted that “Harry is always smiling when he’s with her” and that they are “having a great time together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Harry-Styles-and-Taylor-Russell-Walk-Hand-in-Hand-During-London-Date-2.jpg><p>Though the two have yet to publicly confirm their relationship status, Russell seemingly gave a nod to Styles while discussing what she looks for in a partner in an August interview with <a href=#>The Face</a>. “I’m never going to be volunteering all of my feelings. I’m somebody who, annoyingly, complicatedly, needs things to be asked and pulled from me to talk about it,” the Bones and All actress explained. “But even then I’m like, ‘I’m sorry, is this too much? Is this too much?’ So I need a partner who is going to do that or else it’s never going to work.”</p><p>Russell went on to <a href=#>call love her “favorite drug,”</a> stating, “I mean, love, a lot of the time, feels like a drug. You feel so insane. Being with the person all the time, you’d do anything for them. You’re like, ‘I wanna have all of this stuff with you and I wanna do everything with you.’”</p><p>Russell is one of many high-profile stars Styles has been linked to over the years, having previously dated <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>. Earlier this year, Styles was <a href=#>spotted making out</a> with <a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> in Tokyo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Harry-Styles-and-Taylor-Russell-Walk-Hand-in-Hand-During-London-Date-3.jpg><p>“Harry has always been very attracted to Emily,” another source told <a href=#>Us</a> in March, adding that the Grammy winner was “thrilled” to be “hooking up” with Ratajkowski, 32.</p><p>The model later <a href=#>addressed the PDA pics</a>, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Spanish Vogue</a>, “In the case [of my photos with Harry], it’s more of the same. I feel bad for Olivia because she has had to suffer this situation on several occasions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmaKnxm6%2F07KjnqtdlruledOasKWnomK%2Ftr%2FSnqOlZZikuaV5x5qlnatdnrtuusSwZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-are-15-things-christina-aguilera-is-doing-now-since-leaving-the-voice.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are 15 Things Christina Aguilera Is Doing Now (Since Leaving The Voice)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greg-mathis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-337981-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greg Mathis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
