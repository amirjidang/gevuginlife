It’s true that pretty much everyone loves Star Wars, but not everything about Star Wars is universally praised. There are some things, especially things from the prequels, which people absolutely hate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the story and special effects are among the most universally loved aspects of the series, the dialogue is one of those areas in which <a href=#>George Lucas</a>&nbsp;and company left a lot to be desired. The prequels had some cringe-worthy exchanges between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, along with the use of the word "younglings", and the original trilogy had its fair share of terrible lines. Apart from the dialogue, characters have always been divisive among fans.</p><p>Everyone loves Han Solo, Chewbacca, Yoda and iconic villains like Darth Vader and Boba Fett. However, there are many characters that almost every fan hates with an undying passion. Just about every Star Wars fan above the age of five hates these characters. Most fans wish these characters didn’t exist, and some are hated so much that fans want to see the characters brought back just to be killed off in horrible ways. Here’s a look at the 15 most hated characters in the Star Wars universe. Do you like any of these characters? Which character do you hate the most?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-c-3po><strong>15. C-3PO</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><p>Everyone loves R2-D2, but the same can’t be said about his somewhat irritating sidekick C-3PO. This protocol droid brings much needed comedic relief to the original trilogy, and he certainly isn’t as bad as many of the characters in the prequel films. However, he is certainly not as well loved as most of the other characters from the original film series. The worst thing we can really say about old 3PO is that the concerned shouting and consistent terror in which he lives made him very irritating. He makes this list simply because he does have a fair amount of detractors despite having just as many fans.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-anakin-skywalker><strong>14. Anakin Skywalker</strong></h2><p>via www.fanpop.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most people would agree that Episode I is the worst Star Wars movie, but there are a large number of people who think Episode II is worse. Whichever one you hate more usually comes down to how much you dislike <a href=#>Hayden Christensen</a>. His poor acting combined with cheesy dialogue make Episode II as much of a stinker as The Phantom Menace in many people’s eyes. The excruciating lack of chemistry between Christensen and <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a>’s Padme (as we commented on earlier) make the film practically unwatchable. He became slightly more tolerable in Revenge of the Sith, but it was too little too late. Fans came to hate this whiny Jedi who would eventually become Darth Vader.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-ewoks><strong>13. Ewoks</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><p>Some people love the Ewoks, but a lot of others can’t stand these miniature anthropomorphic bear-like creatures. Despite their primitive nature, they somehow managed to help take down the Empire armed with nothing more than sticks and rocks. Perhaps this ridiculous David vs. Goliath like feat is why they are hated so much. Return of the Jedi is universally considered the worst film of the original Star Wars trilogy, and the Ewoks are one of the reasons why. Many fans hate the Ewoks no matter how cute <a href=#>Warwick Davis</a>’ Wicket was. At least they are not as hated as the Gungans from Episode I.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-sy-snootles><strong>12. Sy Snootles</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.wikia.com</p><p>George Lucas just couldn’t leave the original trilogy alone. In the 90s, he had to go back and update the special effects of the films to make the special editions. One of the most blasphemous and frightening changes he made was the addition of this creepy and oddly sexualized CGI alien to the Jabba’s Palace scene in Return of the Jedi. The bad CGI, her annoying voice and general creepiness make Snootles extremely unlikable. Plus, she epitomizes everything that’s wrong with the special editions. There were enough cool looking creatures in Jabba’s Palace to begin with. The CGI version of this character didn’t need to be added.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-ackmena><strong>11. Ackmena</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Few have seen it, but those that have think it’s as bad or worse than the Star Wars prequels. Not only do fans hate The Star Wars Holiday Special, but so does George Lucas. Rumor has it that Lucas was so ashamed of the holiday cash-in that he stopped it from being released on home video. The whole thing is a mess, but Golden Girls star Bea Arthur starring in the special is just weird. She played a bartender named Ackmena, and she worked the night shift at the Mos Eisley cantina. Her singing and lame jokes make her disliked by Star Wars fans no matter how talented Bea Arthur was.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-dexter-jettster><strong>10. Dexter Jettster</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><p>The original Star Wars trilogy was filled with interesting and innovative creatures. The cantina scene from A New Hope is filled with strange aliens you wouldn’t want to meet in real life. In Episode II, fans didn’t get cool and bizarre miscreants. Instead, they had to endure characters like Dexter Jettster, who runs a 50's style greasy spoon on Coruscant. Why would there be a restaurant like this in a galaxy far, far away, and why would it be run by a four-armed horrible CGI creature who constantly scratches his butt?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-lumpy><strong>9. Lumpy</strong></h2><p>via www.techinsider.com</p><p>Everyone’s favorite wookiee is the proud warrior Chewbacca, who is the loyal sidekick of everyone’s favorite smuggler and scoundrel Han Solo. Everyone’s least favorite wookiee is the annoying little brat Lumpy, who was one of the stars of the horrible Star Wars Holiday Special. Lumpy, whose full name is Lumpawaroo, is actually the son of Chewbacca, and in this case the apple fell pretty far from the tree. Instead of saving the galaxy like his father, Lumpy prefers to stay at home and annoy his grandfather and disobey his mother. Thankfully, the Star Wars Holiday Special has not been seen by many people, so a lot of Star Wars fans have never had to endure this annoying character.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-watto><strong>8. Watto</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watto is annoying, but even worse is that this prequel character is allegedly&nbsp;a horribly racist stereotype. Some say the same thing about&nbsp;Jar Jar Binks and Nute Gunray, but many people think Watto is the most blatant&nbsp;stereotype. Watto is a slave trader and alien junk dealer who is greedy, manipulative and untrustworthy. Even worse is that he has a huge nose. These characteristics may be coincidental, but many critics believe that Watto is a Jewish stereotype. Racist or not, this character is still incredibly awful and annoying, along with being a slaver, a characterization that is petty awful regardless of other issues.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-podracing-announcers-fode-and-beed><strong>7. Podracing Announcers Fode and Beed</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.wikia.com</p><p>Despite the fact that one of the heads of this two-headed alien was voiced by the always hilarious <a href=#>Greg Proops</a>, the pod-racing announcers are still incredibly annoying and absolutely hated by Star Wars fans. Fodesinbeed Annodue, better known as Fode and Beed, spoke two languages as he called the Boonta Eve’s Classic. One head, voice by Proops, spoke English, while the other spoke Huttese. This unloved character would appear in various other Star Wars media such as pod-racing video games, but thankfully he was never seen in another Star Wars film after Episode I.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-nute-gunray-and-rune-hakko><strong>6. Nute Gunray and Rune Hakko</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.com</p><p>These annoying aliens&nbsp;were the one of the first things Star Wars fans were treated to when Episode I opened up in theaters. These evil aliens are universally hated, and when they first appeared in The Phantom Menace, you could almost hear hardcore Star Wars fans let out a collective moan of disgust. A New Hope started off with a cool droid escape and space battle while Episode I started off with these two characters discussing trade deals with Jedi Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-queen-amidala><strong>5. Queen Amidala</strong></h2><p>via youtube</p><p>As much as <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> tried to create a strong female lead for the prequel trilogy, she just couldn’t quite pull it off. Little girls around the world looked up to the strong and noble Princess Leia as she dealt with the destruction of her home planet by Darth Vader. Leia’s heroic efforts helped to bring down the Galactic Empire, and this gained her millions of fans. The same simply cannot be said for Queen Amidala, who is best known for being pregnant and wearing ridiculous make up. She is certainly not a symbol of feminism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-boss-nass><strong>4. Boss Nass</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.wikia.com</p><p>The Gungans, who were made famous in The Phantom Menace,&nbsp;are pretty annoying to begin with. Boss Nass is the rotund king of the underwater dwelling aliens that inhabit Naboo, and this slobbering alien is just one of a thousand reasons Star Wars fans hate episode one. Boss Nass was unbearable nearly every second he was on screen, and couldn’t go more than a minute without violently shaking his jowls. At least the special effects used to create this hated Star Wars character were good, but that’s the only redeeming quality Nass has.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-young-anakin-skywalker><strong>3. Young Anakin Skywalker</strong></h2><p>via www.capcy.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As unbearable as <a href=#>Hayden Christensen</a> was as Anakin Skywalker, <a href=#>Jake Lloyd</a> was even worse. The kid version of Anakin Skywalker made people wonder exactly how an annoying little brat like this could grow up to be one of the most powerful Sith Lords of all time. Fans hated little “Annie” so much that Jake Lloyd’s career was ruined. Even the cool pod race scene couldn’t save young Anakin Skywalker from being one of the most hated Star Wars characters of all time. Thankfully, Darth Vader is so cool that even this little brat couldn’t destroy the legacy of one of the greatest villains in cinematic history.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-battle-droids><strong>2. Battle droids</strong></h2><p>via www.swfanon.wikia.com</p><p>Sure, the Stormtroopers in the original trilogy always missed their mark and were fairly incompetent, but they were highly skilled military personal in comparison to these easily disposed-of droids. The battle droids first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I, and they were so useless that a small army of Gungans easily destroyed them. The annoying “Roger Roger” catchphrase they spouted didn’t help their popularity much, either. When you have an army of villains as useless as this you aren’t doing much to make your film have any feeling of tension.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-jar-jar-binks><strong>1. Jar Jar Binks</strong></h2><p>via www.starwars.wikia.com</p><p>Hands down, the most hated character in the Star Wars universe is Jar Jar Binks. When hardcore Star Wars fans say that George Lucas ruined their childhoods with the prequels, this is exactly what they are talking about. The annoying and clumsy Gungan is so hated that many fans would have actually liked to see him appear in the Force Awakens just so he could be killed off in an excruciatingly painful and violent way. The adult fans of Star Wars that grew up with the original trilogy despise Jar Jar, but many younger people actually like him a lot. Kids think he’s funny, and Lucas has always said that he made the Star Wars movies for kids.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>news.bbc.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>digitalspy.co</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnZ5zKiqrWWYlsGmsIycn5qqkZjBpr7SZqCnZaSdsm6%2F05qpZq%2BRp8Buwc2irZ6qo5p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-didi-richards-raised-by-a-single-mother-details-to-know-about-her-parents-300308-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Didi Richards Raised By A Single Mother?
