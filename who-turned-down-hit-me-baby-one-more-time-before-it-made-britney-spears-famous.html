'Hit Me Baby One More Time' remains her best-selling single, even though it was rejected by several artists before she recorded it.</p><h2 id=who-turned-down-39-baby-one-more-time-39>Who Turned Down 'Baby One More Time'?</h2><p>The song 'Baby One More Time' was written by Max Martin in 1998, and the Swedish singer/songwriter already had an artist in mind when penning the lyrics. That wasn't Britney Spears. It was <strong>The Backstreet Boys.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/backstreet-boys-at-awards-show.jpg><p>The American boy band were already international heartthrobs at this point and Martin believed that 'Baby One More Time' would be a worthy addition to their back catalog of pop bangers. However, the group turned the song down. It would appear that the guys have never commented on this well-documented rejection, although it's not as if their careers took a huge downturn afterward. Their success continued for many decades and they're still in the public eye today.</p><p>The song was also reportedly offered to <strong>TLC, </strong>but the R&B girl group also rejected the chance to record it. It would have been interesting to hear how this song would sound with the smooth urban vocals of Tionne, Rozanna and Lisa "Left-Eye" Lopez. But we can now only imagine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tlc-girl-band-at-awards-show.jpg><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview published by NME, Tionne said</a> the band has no regrets about turning the track down.</p><p>She said: "I like the song but do I think it's a hit? Do I think it's TLC? I'm not saying 'hit me baby'. No disrespect to Britney. It's good for her. But was I going to say 'hit me baby one more time'? Hell no!"</p><p><a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> also supposedly caught wind of the song before it was released and begged Max Martin to give it to British boy band <strong>Five, </strong>who he was managing. However, that deal never came to pass either. Five was an incredibly popular act in the UK at the time. Could this have been the song that allowed them to break the international market?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, the song eventually made its way to Britney Spears' team who made it the lead single for her debut album.

She was just 16 years old. The single was so popular that Spears became one of the world's most famous and beloved pop stars overnight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-hit-me-baby-one-more-time-music-video-schoolgirl.jpg><p>The iconic music video certainly played its role in the song's success too. It featured Spears dancing inside a high school with pigtails and a sexy schoolgirl outfit. This risqué and novel idea came from the mind of Spears herself.
