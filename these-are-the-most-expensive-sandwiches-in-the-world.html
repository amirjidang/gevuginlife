This ancient finger meal is undergoing a resurgence as <a href=#>chefs around the world</a> take it out of the lunchbox and onto the restaurant table, substituting peanut butter and jelly with abalone, gourmet cheese, truffle, <a href=#>expensive champagne</a>, and even 24-karat gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that there aren't many things that people won't put on bread. One of the most famous sandwiches is the lobster roll. If you want to eat one of these sandwiches then you are going to need to prepare yourself because they are not cheap, in fact, they are very expensive. In this blog, we will be taking a look at the 10 most expensive sandwiches in the world.</p><h2 id=wagyu-ribeye-and-foie-gras-cheesesteak-120>Wagyu Ribeye And Foie Gras Cheesesteak – $120</h2><p>It is highly likely that those who appreciate Philly cheesesteaks will find this to be either the costliest option available or one of the most expensive ones available. It is precisely what it sounds like, albeit it is funny to note that their Cheese Whiz comes with truffles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=von-essen-platinum-club-sandwich-150>Von Essen Platinum Club Sandwich – $150</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Von Essen Platinum Club Sandwich</a> costs approximately $150 and comes with ham, chicken from a coveted French breed, and quail eggs, all of which complement the other components, such as white truffles and semi-dried Italian tomatoes, pretty nicely.</p><h2 id=cheese-sandwich-170>Cheese Sandwich – $170</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is without a doubt one of the most expensive cheese sandwiches that one could ever hope to find. The cheddar cheese is probably the essential component of this recipe, but it also contains a number of other noteworthy ingredients, such as an heirloom tomato, white truffles, and an epicure apple. This item, like many others on this list, contains gold dust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Gelatos In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-nouveau-burger-175>Richard Nouveau Burger – $175</h2><p>The Richard Nouveau Burger is made with Kobe beef that has been enhanced by black truffles and seared foie gras. For whatever reason, this <a href=#>expensive burger</a> also contains gold leaf for those who appreciate that sort of thing.</p><h2 id=breaded-wagyu-beef-cutlet-sandwich-180>Breaded Wagyu Beef Cutlet Sandwich – $180</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Certain varieties of Japanese beef have garnered an excellent reputation. Nevertheless, cattle are still cattle, thus the tenderloin remains among the most coveted slices of beef due to its tenderness and relative scarcity. Therefore, it is not surprising that the breaded wagyu beef cutlet sandwich from Wagyumafia costs $180, given that it contains meat from a cut so small that it can only be used to make six sandwiches.</p><h2 id=quintessential-grilled-cheese-sandwich-214>Quintessential Grilled Cheese Sandwich – $214</h2><p>This sandwich has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. Essentially, Dom Perignon Champagne and white truffle butter were used to make the bread, while Caciocavallo Podolico was used to make the cheese. However, one of the most notable features of this sandwich is that it contains 24K gold leaf, which is made of pure gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=le-burger-extravagant-295>Le Burger Extravagant – $295</h2><p>Occasionally, food items have names that are really apt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Burger Extravagant</a>, for instance, is precisely what it sounds like. The delicacy begins with a wagyu beef patty, which is enhanced with truffle butter and Kaluga caviar, among other ingredients. It suffices to state that each of these ingredients is pricey on its own, and significantly more so when combined into a sandwich.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Belts In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=douche-burger-666>Douche Burger – $666</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Franz Aliquo of the food truck 666 Burger prepares the Douche Burger. It is a cheeseburger, but it is unlike any other cheeseburger. Instead, it is loaded with pricey additives. For instance, its burger is comprised of <a href=#>Kobe beef</a>. In addition to other pricey components such as truffles and gruyere cheese, it also contains meats such as caviar, lobster, and foie gras. In addition, its fabrication incorporates gold foil, allegedly to make it even closer to its intended form. However, the most ludicrous aspect of this item is that it is wrapped in three $100 bills, which is as disgusting as it sounds.</p><h2 id=seven-emirates-burgerstack-10-000>Seven Emirates Burgerstack – $10,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Seven Emirates Burgerstack is presumably excluded from Aliquo's verdict. In the end, it was unable to fetch the price tag of $10,000 on account of either the scale of the product's size or the high cost of the ingredients that went into its creation. Due to the fact that it was auctioned for philanthropic purposes, the Seven Emirates Burgertack was able to fetch $10,000. In terms of its ingredients, it has a saffron brioche bun, beef patties, veal bacon strips, and <a href=#>different types of cheese</a>, which makes it unique but not exactly outlandish in comparison to the other sandwiches in this group.</p><h2 id=the-virgin-mary-28-000>The Virgin Mary – $28,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Occasionally, value has nothing to do with ingredients. The most expensive sandwich ever sold was a regular cheese and toast sandwich, not one with truffles or gold. What was imprinted on the charred crust made all the difference. Diane Muyser, the owner of a business in Miami, Florida, felt she could see a vision of the Virgin Mary. This inspired her to attempt to sell the sandwich on eBay, where she made $28,000. Not bad for a piece of stale toast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Sail The Ocean With The $250 Million Superyacht Of UFC Owner Frank Fertitta III</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money INC</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pouted</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twisted Food</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnKydXZa%2FpnnToZxmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7Juv8Cnm7Chk52ytHnIp2StoJVixLC%2By51m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-is-justinsske-in-jail-justin-mcnease-arrested.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TikTok: Is Justinsske In Jail?
