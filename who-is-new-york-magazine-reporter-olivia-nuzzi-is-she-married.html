She the magazine’s first ever Washington correspondent. She also writes about congress in the magazine and its Daily Intel blog.</p><p>She began her career in journalism at the age of 18 writing for TriCity News and was also a regular contributor to the conservative blog More Monmouth Musings. She interned in Anthony Weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign for four weeks before joining N/SFWcorp.</p><p>After she joined N/SFWcorp she was highly critical of Weiner and his senior staff in her stories. In one of the blogs, she wrote about her internship experience where she claimed that Weiner called her and 20 other female interns “Monica” because he failed to remember their names.</p><p>She was later hired by the New York Daily News to write a follow-up piece about interning for Weiner. In 2014, she was hired by the Daily Beast to cover the presidential campaigns of Republican hopefuls Rand Paul and Chris Christie. During her tenure, she wrote stories about Donald Trump’s rise as a Republican leader.</p><p>In 2016, Politico named her among the “16 Breakout Media Stars” of the presidential election.

On December 23, 2022 she wrote an investigative article on Donald Trump about his final campaign. In the article she quoted several anonymous sources who gave an insight on the politician’s post-Presidency life and commented on his bid to run for the White House once again.</p><p>In the report she alleged that a former White House official and Trump loyalist told her that Trump was an “isolated figure” who did not want to run for the White House, but announced his bid to “prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Other sources allegedly claimed that trump mostly stays in his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, and only leaves home to play golf at his club in Doral.</p><p>“He just goes, plays golf, comes back, and f***s off. He has retreated to the golf course and to Mar-a-Lago. His world has gotten much smaller. His world is so, so small.”</p><p>She also wrote that an advisor who works on Trump’s ongoing campaign allegedly told her that the politician’s appeal was “gone” and that he cannot get it back in the future:</p><p>“It’s not there. In this business, you can have it and have it so hot and it can go overnight and it’s gone and you can’t get it back. I think we’re just seeing it’s gone. The magic is gone.”</p><p>In the article, she said that she spoke with Donald Trump in an interview but he allegedly denied all claims made by the insiders.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=donald-trump-response></span>Donald Trump Response<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Donald Trump made a response about the article claiming it was all fake and termed Nuzzi’s sources as non-existence.</p><p>“The Fake & Corrupt News is only getting worse! As an example, I agreed to do a short telephone interview for a once very good, but now on its “last legs” and failing, New York Magazine. The reporter was a shaky & unattractive wack job, known as “tough” but dumb as a rock, who actually wrote a decent story about me a long time ago. Her name, Olivia Nuzzi. Anyway, the story was Fake News, her “anonymous sources” don’t exist (true with many writers), and I’m happily fighting hard for our GREAT USA!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-salary></span>Olivia Nuzzi Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her annual base salary is estimated to be $87,456.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-net-worth></span>Olivia Nuzzi Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynnLBlqaS%2FrHnMmp6aspmjsm6%2BxKmmq6yVp3qwuMivoJplnqrHu7WMoqpmq5iaeq6t0augnpxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wolf-pack-cast-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wolf Pack Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-judge-judy-granddaughter-sara-rose.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Judge Judy's Granddaughter, Sara Rose?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
