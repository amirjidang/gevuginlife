However, nobody can say for sure. Since then, rumors circulated that either Kevin Durant or Blake Griffin was the father, but once Lana shared a photo of herself and the child, the fans had an instant realization as to who it really was. What transpired between Durant and Rhoades exactly, and who is this baby’s father?</p><h2 id=kevin-durant-and-lana-rhoades-may-have-briefly-dated-and-it-didn-rsquo-t-go-well>Kevin Durant And Lana Rhoades May Have Briefly Dated, And It Didn’t Go Well</h2><p>Lana Rhoades dropped some knowledge bombs on her "3 Girls, 1 Kitchen" podcast in early 2022. The adult actress revealed the details of her disastrous date with an NBA star.</p><p>Rhoades claimed that a player invited her to a postseason match. She and her pals had a blast during the game, where they watched the playoffs and supported the team. After the game, things went downhill quickly, and a date ended up being a total bust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1.png><p>When Rhoades accepted a dinner invitation from her date, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upset her by bringing along another woman</a>. She believed she had been friendzoned and talked about the experience as a "very boring date" on her podcast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kendall Jenner Fans Say She Has 'Zero Chemistry' With NBA Beau Devin Booker</a></span></p><p>During the podcast, Rhoades said, "The guy who invited me also invited one of the other girls and this isn't the first time that this has happened to me that where I've been invited on a date and they also invite a 'backup option.'"</p><p>Although she did not name the NBA player, all indications go to Kevin Durant. The influencer was apparently on a date with a major Brooklyn Nets player.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.png><p>She might have been out with Durant, Kyrie Irving, or Ben Simmons, but she also disclosed that her date was a Libra. This eliminated everyone except for Durant. NBA players are <a href=#>known for sparking relationship controversy</a>, so pinning this down may be challenging.</p><p>Although Rhoades has been mum on the subject, rumors have it that Durant is the father of her child. Keep in mind that this was just one date she detailed with the unknown player.</p><p>No one knows for sure if there were other dates between them or not.</p><h2 id=lana-rhoades-doesn-rsquo-t-want-the-scandal-to-affect-her-baby-daddy-rsquo-s-career-but-she-isn-rsquo-t-stopping-the-rumors-either>Lana Rhoades Doesn’t Want The Scandal To Affect Her Baby Daddy’s Career, But She Isn’t Stopping The Rumors Either</h2><p>Rhoades recently posted a video to her Instagram in which she criticizes NBA players, including the NBA superstar who is widely believed to be responsible for her pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was on video saying, "I swear to God, I thought NBA players were nice guys. Next thing you know, I said, 'I'm pregnant'… And he told me to go f**k myself."</p><p>Supposedly, Rhoades had a relationship with a Libra on the Nets' roster. Strangely, Kevin Durant is the only Libra, and Rhoades has admitted that she once went on a date that ended disastrously because the NBA player was so uninterested he invited a second woman as a backup plan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3.png><p>Another common theory shows that Blake Griffin, who she was rumored to have dated, was the father of her child. As it turns out, Adam22 confirmed on TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that Griffin is indeed the father of Rhoades’ baby</a>. However, she has not confirmed this for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Rumors Adele Is Dating NBA Agent Rich Paul</a></span></p><p>Since the news of the Playboy model's pregnancy surfaced, Durant has received the lion's share of the credit, perhaps due to the fact that he is the most despised person in the NBA and the most vocal one on social media, going as far as to being <a href=#>fined $50K from a rough Instagram exchange with Michael Rapaport</a>.</p><p>To Durant’s relief, Rhoades posted photos of her newborn on social media, and the public agreed that the youngster couldn't look more like Griffin. And NBA fans on Twitter are convinced that the newest Celtic is the father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nobody in the world could persuade you otherwise if you saw the former Clippers superstar's childhood photograph. No DNA test needed. It certainly isn't deceiving NBA Twitter.</p><p>Rhoades has apparently made it clear that she does not want the issue surrounding her baby daddy's identity to have a negative impact on his career, but she is also not remaining silent, which is only adding gasoline to the flames of fan speculation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5.png><p>For the time being, Durant can rest easy because no evidence links him to the unidentified father of the child. One can't help but speculate whether or if Rhoades will shock NBA fans by revealing the identity of the baby daddy in the near future. Hopefully, it may put an end to the <a href=#>possible internal beef going on between the NBA players</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-lana-rhoades-attacked-by-fans>Why Was Lana Rhoades Attacked By Fans?</h2><p>Rhoades reportedly received a lot of backlash online from trolls who stated she should have still gone to bed with him because of her background, forcing her to vent her frustrations and send some stern comments via her various social media accounts.</p><p>"The way men are allowed to talk to/about woman online is disgusting, and often praised for. I can’t wait till misogyny is something they can be canceled for," the former adult film star posted on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6.png><p>"I don’t care what respect anyone thinks I deserve because of my past decisions. I will take the respect that I want. And if someone can’t give it to me, I will not engage with you," Rhoades concluded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Adult Film Star Mary Carey Has Done Since 'Celebrity Rehab'</a></span></p><p>You can't argue with her logic. Even if we're talking about an NBA superstar, it doesn't change the fact that she's still a person with the right to say no when she doesn't want to be with someone.</p><p>Currently, all we can do is piece together what happened. There are no absolute statements being made, but there are questions being raised. We might still be missing a dozen twists in the story.</p><p>Will she finally tell us who the baby’s father is?
