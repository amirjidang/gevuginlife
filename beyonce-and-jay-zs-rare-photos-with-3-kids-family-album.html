Three years later, the “Love on Top” singer announced she was pregnant with a <a href=#>show-stopping onstage reveal</a> during her performance at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. <a href=#>Blue Ivy Carter</a> was born the following January.</p><p>“Being pregnant was very much like falling in love. You are so open,” the Texas native gushed in HBO’s Life Is But a Dream documentary in 2013. “You are so overjoyed. There’s no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone.”</p><p>That same year, Beyoncé called her daughter her “best friend,” telling Vogue that <a href=#>Blue’s birth was “the best day” of her life</a>. “Right now, after giving birth, I really understand the power of my body,” the Grammy winner said. “I just feel my body means something completely different. I feel a lot more confident about it. Even being heavier, thinner, whatever. I feel a lot more like a woman. More feminine, more sensual. And no shame.”</p><p>Blue became a big sibling in June 2017 when <a href=#>twins Rumi and Sir Carter</a> arrived. The Ivy Park founder broke social media records with <a href=#>her pregnancy announcement</a> earlier that year and shared the first photo of the newborns in July 2017.</p><p>“My body went through more than I knew it could,” the “Sorry” singer recalled of her pregnancy in <a href=#>Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé</a>, which hit Netflix in 2019. “I had an extremely difficult pregnancy. I had high blood pressure. I developed toxemia, preeclampsia. And in the womb, one of my babies’ heartbeat paused a few times, so I had to get an emergency C-section.”</p><p>The documentary <a href=#>briefly featured</a> Blue and the twins, showing how the little ones play a part in life on the road with their parents. In June 2019, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the rapper and his wife <a href=#>“mostly try and bring the kids everywhere”</a> without relying too much on nannies and assistants.</p><p>“Blue always travels with Beyoncé and comes with her when she’s working,” the insider added. “The twins are getting older and Beyoncé has been taking them out a little more too. … They’re a very tight-knit family and like to do everything together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Formation” singer has been candid about the <a href=#>challenges of raising three kids</a> as a working parent, telling Harper’s Bazaar in April 2021 that self-care and wellness is the “backbone” of her and Jay-Z’s family. “I didn’t realize how much that takes a toll on my mental and physical well-being,” she told the outlet. “I have not always made myself a priority. … Your body tells you everything you need to know, but I’ve had to learn to listen.”</p><p>Scroll down to see rare photos of Blue, Rumi and Sir through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkr6bFzqeanmWRo7FutsCyZLOrXaeus7GMqZ%2BorJ%2Boeri106FkbGWbnrG0ecWapKKkqWKura7UpmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-daddy-kane-calls-j-cole-hero-1234727563.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Big Daddy Kane Calls J.
