The star has made headlines for ages for her wild <a href=#>fashion choices</a>, her <a href=#>relationships</a>, and even rumored relationships (such as her <a href=#>friendship with Bradley Cooper</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Surprising Facts About Lady Gaga (Before She Was Famous)</a></span></p><p>But recently, Lady Gaga revealed she was dating Michael Polansky, leading fans to obsess over the new guy in Gaga's life. Not to worry: here are all the details fans are clamoring to learn about Michael Polansky (and his relationship with Lady Gaga).</p><h2 id=michael-polansky-s-net-worth-rivals-his-girlfriend-s><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Michael Polansky's Net Worth Rivals His Girlfriend's</span></h2><p>Michael Polansky is not just arm candy for one of the biggest musicians in the industry. He might be dating Lady Gaga, but Polansky also went to Harvard and now works with Facebook co-founder Sean Parker.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HITC</a>&nbsp;confirms that while no one knows his exact net worth, estimates place Michael Polansky's "value" at between $300 and $600 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Which Pop Queen Is Richer: Beyonce Or Lady Gaga?</a></span></p><p>That's more than Lady Gaga's estimated $275 million net worth, making the pair a true power couple. Obviously, Michael doesn't need Gaga's fame to earn him money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-tech-entrepreneur-is-a-ceo><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Tech Entrepreneur Is A CEO</span></h2><p>As HITC explains, Polansky is the CEO of The Parker Group, which includes the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Essentially, he works for a private philanthropy firm, which might be one of the reasons why Lady Gaga is so smitten.</p><p>After all, Lady Gaga has her own charitable foundation and makes big moves toward bringing attention to social issues. No doubt Michael can also offer Gaga advice on her business operations since he's a CEO and all! As you'll soon learn, the pair have worked together already.</p><h2 id=michael-s-ex-wrote-an-op-ed-about-him-and-gaga><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michael's Ex Wrote An Op-Ed About Him And Gaga</span></h2><p>While the headline drew attention, the content wasn't that scandalous. But it's true that Michael Polanksy's ex-girlfriend, Lindsay Crouse, a senior staff editor at&nbsp;The New York Times, wrote an op-ed about being the ex of Lady Gaga's newest flame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay and Michael dated for seven years, and when news broke that her ex was Lady Gaga's new flame, <a href=#>Lindsay explained</a> that friends started calling and checking in on her. Fortunately, the former couple ended on good terms, and Lindsay had nothing but good things to say about Gaga.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-likely-met-michael-through-his-work-partner><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lady Gaga Likely Met Michael Through His Work Partner</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, it's most likely that Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky met through Sean Parker. After all, Sean Parker hosts plenty of industry events, including one where Gaga performed and charmed Bradley Cooper. After seeing Lady Gaga perform, <a href=#>Cooper opted to cast her</a> in&nbsp;A Star is Born.</p><p>It's quite possible that Lady Gaga similarly charmed Michael Polansky when the pair attended another of Sean Parker's events. "Sources" say it was Parker's birthday party in December of 2019 that was the magic moment for the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-has-worked-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Couple Has Worked Together</span></h2><p>Elle&nbsp;explained that Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky (among a long list of others!) <a href=#>collaborated</a> on a benefit for those dealing with the coronavirus. The fundraiser was the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which Lady Gaga repped for back in April. The two have also been vocal about masking up and protecting others.</p><p>With Lady Gaga's background in charity and Michael's connections to cancer research&nbsp;& more, it's not surprising that the super-philanthropic pair decided to put their quarantine time to good use. Just another reason to ship the couple, right?</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-might-want-kids-with-michael><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lady Gaga Might Want Kids With Michael</span></h2><p>In an interview following the publicizing of her relationship with Michael, Lady Gaga explained how much she wants marriage and kids. Of course, that came after her pronouncement that she wants to do more charity work and raise money to find cures for many modern diseases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Lady Gaga also elaborated that she looks forward to becoming a mom and is "very excited" to have kids. And with Lady Gaga being 34 in 2020 and Michael age 42, the timing might just be right for both of them.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-s-man-wines-and-dines-her><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lady Gaga's Man Wines And Dines Her</span></h2><p>Though Lady Gaga has a high enough net worth of her own,&nbsp;Elle's sources said that Michael was happy to wine and dine his lady. He likes to spoil the star, the publication noted, even though the singer can clearly buy whatever her heart desires.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Stunning Photos Of Lady Gaga’s Car Collection</a></span></p><p>From her car collection to her property, Lady Gaga has everything a girl could want. But a guy who dotes on her is just what all of Gaga's fans want for the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-michael-is-super-private-online><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>But Michael Is Super Private Online</span></h2><p>Unlike his leading lady, Michael Polansky seems to keep his social media locked down. While multiple journalists have cited his LinkedIn experience in their articles on the now-celebrity, Michael's social media flies under the radar. With just a few hundred followers, Michael has his Instagram set to private.</p><p>So while he's open about the fact that he's dating Gaga, Michael doesn't splash pics of the pair all over the web. And while Lady Gaga has posted pics of them, she also shared a video of them dancing to <a href=#>songs from Chromatica</a>.</p><h2 id=the-relationship-got-serious-fast><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Relationship Got Serious, Fast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Describing Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky's relationship timeline,&nbsp;Elle&nbsp;explained that 'sources' said the pair had been dating for a month before they went all-in. If the timeline of their first meeting adds up, the couple only waited a month or two before Lady Gaga started sharing cute couple snaps on Instagram.</p><p>From a photo of Lady Gaga sitting on Michael's lap to a selfie of the pair on Valentine's day, things went quickly. Then the couple started quarantining together, reported&nbsp;Elle. What a way to spend lockdown!</p><h2 id=they-might-be-getting-married-in-private><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Might Be Getting Married (In Private)</span></h2><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OK! Magazine</a> reported recently, though the couple has only been together about eight months, they have plans to elope. The publication elaborated that the couple's plans to head to Las Vegas, Nevada to tie the knot in a private ceremony have <a href=#>recently surfaced</a>.</p><p>Fans will have to wait and see if the rumors turn out to be true, or if it's just wishful thinking. Of course, the two could turn out to be soul mates, and fans are totally here for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Timeline Of All Of Lady Gaga's Relationships</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmpypYrSis8Bmmaixlqe2prrDZqSim5iWsq15z6ijmqajoMZw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./13-celebs-with-the-most-insane-car-collections.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>13 Celebs With The Most Insane Car Collections</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-of-the-worlds-most-eligible-royals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Of The World's Most Eligible Royals</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
