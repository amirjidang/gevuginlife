In fact, one of the producers of 19 Kids and Counting aimed to recreate the Duggars' success with a new family — this one featuring 12 kids — immediately after the Duggars went off the air. Unfortunately, the Willis family's story also ended in tragedy, just like the Duggars', as TLC seemed hopeful that it could replace one large, religious family with another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=19-kids-and-counting-ended-in-2015-and-the-willis-family-began-the-same-year>19 Kids And Counting Ended In 2015, And The Willis Family Began The Same Year</h2><h3 id=the-duggar-family-39-s-producer-writer-director-launched-a-new-show-when-19-kids-wrapped>The Duggar family's producer-writer-director launched a new show when 19 Kids wrapped</h3><p></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/duggar-family-in-2007-tlc.jpg><p>Odds are that TLC has plenty of crew members that work on multiple projects, but Duggar fans recognized the name Sean Overbeeke when he was credited on another TLC program. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean was an executive/series producer, writer, and director on 19 Kids and Counting</a> (though he never worked on Counting On) and likely quite familiar with the Duggars.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jim-bob-duggar-talking-on-tlc.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="After Years Of Not Giving His Kids Their TLC Money, Jim Bob Duggar Offered Them $10 An Hour">After Years Of Not Giving His Kids Their TLC Money, Jim Bob Duggar Offered Them $10 An Hour</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jim Bob only offered to give his kids any money after being confronted by Jill and her husband Derick.</p><p>In 2015, when 19 Kids was winding down, thanks to Josh Duggar's name being in the news, Sean launched another show titled The Willis Family. At the time, viewers didn't think much of TLC's attempt at bringing another big family onto its stage.

While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recapping a poorly-received Duggar "special,"</a> one fan wrote, "The striking similarities in the new show about the Willis family feels like further evidence that this show is circling the drain."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were some differences between the Duggars and Willises that initially had fans rooting for TLC's new show. Many viewers pointed out that while it's common for large, religious families to have "music ministry," many were "not good." In contrast, the Willis family was multi-talented, even making it to the quarterfinals on America's Got Talent."</p><p>The family was also quite similar to the Duggars, including in the naming scheme for their twelve kids; Toby and Brenda Willis had four sons (Jeremiah, Jackson, Jedidiah, and Jaeger) and eight daughters (Jessica, Jennifer, Jeanette, Jasmine, Juliette, Jamie, Joy, and Jada) all with J names.</p><p>Sadly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans' initial observations during The Willis Family's first few episodes</a> turned out to be correct and heartbreaking.</p><p>The kids were hilarious, the mom seemed lovely, and the dad…seemed off to me at first.

At that point, TLC cancelled the family's show. Sadly, that single charge spiraled into more, and it was revealed that Willis had been abusing his own children.</p><p>Ultimately, Willis received two 25-year sentences on two counts, then two 40-year sentences on two other counts after pleading guilty.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willis was sentenced to 40 years in prison</a>, with the sentences being served concurrently.</p><h2 id=fans-suspect-tlc-hoped-to-replace-the-duggars>Fans Suspect TLC Hoped To Replace The Duggars</h2><h3 id=tlc-may-have-given-up-on-its-quot-fundie-quot-programming>TLC may have given up on its "fundie" programming</h3><p></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/toby-willis-jail.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duggar snarkers on Reddit had thoughts when Jessica Willis Fisher's memoir was released</a>. The memoir gave a glimpse into Jessica's home life and her father's abuse, with many commenters praising her strength in coming forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many viewers were critical of TLC's dealings with Toby Willis, it's said that one TLC crew member blew the whistle that wound up helping the kids escape. Still, not everyone thinks TLC should be forgiven for its perceived wrongs.</p><p>TLC doesn't seem to look beneath the surface of the families they choose to platform. They certainly don't look out for the children of these families. In my opinion, this makes TLC as unethical as Jim Bob.</p><p>Commenters suggested that the Duggars didn't care about their reality show cast, and only wanted to make money. Of course, TLC released a statement saying the network was shocked by Willis' arrest and that they had performed thorough background checks on the entire family and found nothing.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-truth-about-seeking-sister-wife-s-garrick-and-dannielle-s-relationship-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Whatever Happened To TLC's Other Shows About Polygamist Marriage?">Whatever Happened To TLC's Other Shows About Polygamist Marriage?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sister Wives might be the most famous TLC series on polygamy, but there are other shows in the works.</p><p>Sadly, that was true, but only because the Willis kids' suffering was kept so closely under wraps despite their family being broadcasted on reality TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbmkedOrsGasn2K%2FprzLmpqeZaSdsm6w1KCemqqjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-sizemore-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Sizemore Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-malone-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-573238-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Malone Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
