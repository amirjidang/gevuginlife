We were surrounded by family and friends from every chapter of our lives. The distance people traveled to help honor our precious baby boy has humbled us to our core.”</p><p>Merritt Walker also <a href=#>issued a thank you for the support</a> she received after Callahan’s passing.</p><p>“Thank you for sharing your own hearts and pain with us,” she concluded. “You all have been with us on so many mountaintop moments, and we want to thank those of you that were/ are willing to show up for us in the most excruciatingly painful valley as well.”</p><p>Merritt Walker included photos of a program from the celebration of life event, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a>. There was also a eulogy from Merritt Walker and Walker titled “Reflections of CalBear’s Big Little Life.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the pair shared a joint statement announcing that <a href=#>Callahan died in a “tragic accident.”</a> (Merritt Walker and Walker also <a href=#>share sons Beckham, 10, and Chamberlain</a>, 7.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blogger-Laura-Merritt-Walkers-3-Year-Old-Son-Honored-With-Celebration-of-Life-After-His-Death-2.jpg><p>“We are completely broken-hearted to share that we lost our precious Callahan in a tragic accident last week,” they wrote via Instagram on February 12. “He was such a blessing and brought so much joy to our whole family. Cal-Bear was absolutely adored by his big brothers and loved them beyond measure. As parents we are completely shattered at the loss of our baby boy.”</p><p>Merritt Walker and Walker said they took “comfort” knowing Callahan is being “held in the arms of Jesus.” They asked for prayers for their family during “this impossible time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Frisco Texas Fire Department later confirmed to multiple outlets that they responded to a call from the Walker family regarding a drowning but declined to provide further details.</p><p>Before the celebration of life, Merritt Walker uploaded a link to a Spotify playlist that helped the family as they grieved Callahan.</p><p>“We wanted to share a playlist we have put together. It has been on repeat in our home. The truth of these songs is blessing us every day,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on February 18. “These are songs that we have loved in our family for years and each hold a special place to us. We hope they can bless you and meet you wherever you are at God is good. We are learning to praise Him in the valley and the mountaintop all the same.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmaWnrm65xKupoqykYsSiuMqeqWagn6O8s7%2BMrKanZaeewal5wp6jnpqilsGqu81mpp9lnJ6zpnnAn6ueql2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-elizah-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-95557-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Elizah Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kimberly-elise-trammel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kimberly Elise Trammel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
