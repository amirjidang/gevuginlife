Can you imagine Willow and Wesley Wyndham-Pryce together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not uncommon to date your co-stars, but Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof were only co-stars for a single season and were still able to form a relationship before&nbsp;Denisof moved to Angel, Buffy's spinoff. Now they've been married for seventeen years, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">look just as great as all the other Scoobies.</a></p><p>We might not have gotten&nbsp;the real-life relationship between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel (David&nbsp;Boreanaz) that we dreamed of, but it's always nice to think that some real love came out of the show. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it makes us even more nostalgic.</a></p><p>Here's what Hannigan and Denisof's relationship has been like over the years.</p><h2 id=from-co-stars-to-lovers>From Co-Stars to Lovers</h2><p>Even though Willow and Wesley never had a romantic relationship on Buffy, the attraction was apparently there between the actors. Not unlike Welsey trying to pursue Cordelia in season three, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannigan was actually the one to pursue Denisof at first.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannigan told The Sun in 2012 that she had to convince him to date her because he was unsure if he wanted to date one of his co-stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Buffy The Vampire Slayer’: What Happened To Charisma Carpenter After Her Role As Cordelia?</a></span></p><p>''I was trying to pursue him, but he said he didn't want to date somebody he was working with. But we developed a great friendship..." Hannigan said. "When my new relationship ran its course, the whole thing suddenly changed and Alex and I started to really care about each other. So it was two years before we started seeing each other and that was back in 1999. I took my mom's advice and thought really hard about the whole thing—and didn't marry until I was nearly 30.''</p><p>Recently Hannigan has&nbsp;revealed more&nbsp;about&nbsp;her decision to start dating Denisof. After politician Stacey Abrams, tweeted her views of the long-time battle of who was better for Buffy, Angel, or Spike, Hannigan weighed in on the topic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hilariously, her response was;&nbsp;"Actually Buffy should have dated Willow." When one fan replied that it would have ruined their friendship, Hannigan replied, "That’s what @AnthonySHead [Giles]&nbsp;told me when @AlexisDenisof and I were thinking about dating 20 years ago!"</p><p>Despite the warnings from Head, Hannigan and Denisof proceeded and took a chance with dating each other. Not long after that, in 2003, shortly after Buffy ended, they got married in a private destination wedding near Palm Springs, California.</p><p>Their wedding was not your typical wedding, however. They had a photo booth, choreographed dance routines, and even a trampoline, and their first dance was a medley of 'Over the Rainbow' (because Denisof proposed under a rainbow) and Los Umbrellos' 'No Tengo Dinero,' a song that their characters first danced to on Buffy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-formed-a-really-close-family>They've Formed A Really Close Family</h2><p>Hannigan and Denisof are&nbsp;very close and have become a sort of power couple over the years, so when they started to have kids they wanted a similar relationship as a family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Buffy The Vampire Slayer’: What Happened To James Marsters After His Role As Spike?</a></span></p><p>They had their first daughter, Satyana, in 2009, and their second, Keeva, in 2012. Both were born at home with the assistance of a midwife.</p><p>The birth of a second child always changes things, however,&nbsp;and when Keeva was born it changed things for the better. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannigan credits Keeva's birth as the reason why she and Denisof have become better parents and also a better couple.</a></p><p>"There's such a huge learning curve, especially with the first baby," she told Yahoo News! "Everything seems like, 'If I don't change this diaper correctly, she won't go to college.' My advice is, know that the time does go by fast...it's a huge roller coaster, it's the hardest thing and most rewarding thing. Bear with it and communicate. Our second child was 2 by the time Alexis and I figured out how to be a couple and parents."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Sarah Michelle Gellar Made From ‘Buffy The Vampire Slayer’</a></span></p><p>Besides doing a lot of things with their daughters (as Hannigan's Instagram reveals), including go on tons of vacations and having the best family Halloween costumes ever, the couple is able to keep their romance alive. They renewed their vows on their tenth anniversary in 2013.</p><p>Hannigan tweeted about how her husband proposed to her the second time, writing,&nbsp;"My hubby @AlexisDenisof surprised me with the most romantic day of my life yesterday! Which included another proposal & ring! I said YES!" This time the ceremony took place in Hawaii with their daughters.</p><p>When asked by Us Weekly if they'd consider another kid, Hannigan replied no, but they did recently adopt a puppy and that's like having a new baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also revealed that she hates when she and Denisof are away from each other. "I feel like part of my heart is gone when he’s gone," she explained. "Like right now, he’s been in Atlanta for like the last two or three weeks and we don’t know when he’s coming back. I’m like, ‘Do we need to come for a three-day weekend? Should we just come to you?’ I’m very excited for him to come back."</p><p>Denisof did eventually come home of course and spent time with his family shortly after in quarantine. The couple had to put a hold on their work like everyone else in the industry but the lockdown has not affected their marriage in the slightest.</p><p>Denisoff is thankful that he starred in Buffy because it brought him his love, and it's clear that Hannigan feels the same way. Willow's true love might have been Tara but Hannigan's will always be Denisof.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Michelle Gellar Becomes Buffy Again… With A Pinkish Twist</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJqkqai8r3nHmqWnoZeWu7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZKKrXaG2rLGMsKCtoF2WuabEyKxknZ2ensCwso4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-hilaria-baldwin-legal-name.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's When (And Possibly Why) Hillary &amp;quot;Hilaria&amp;quot; Baldwin Legally Changed Her Name</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./girl-falls-25-feet-off-six-flags-ride-bystanders-catch-her-watch-w489757.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Girl Falls 25 Feet Off Six Flags Ride, Bystanders Catch Her: Watch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
