Now let’s finish our house and get hitched already hehe.”</p><p>The social media uploaded <a href=#>featured various photos from the festivities</a> — including an adorable snap of their rescue dog Maki. Heringer and Erb, who have been documenting their home’s construction, have also used their platform <a href=#>to share the news about their new pet.</a></p><p>“Meet Macchiato aka Maki! 🐶☕️ He was rescued from a LA shelter (where he was on the euthanasia list and on his final plea due to the lack of space 🥺) and we think he’s a 2 years old German Shepherd Collie mix!” Heringer wrote via Instagram in August. “We were originally waiting to rescue a pup until we got to Oklahoma but through a series of events — Maki found his way to us and we couldn’t be more in love! More to share on this story soon ◡̈ In the meantime — us three are gearing up for the 22 hour drive to our new home next week — wish us luck! 😅🫶🏼.”</p><p>Later that month, the Bachelor Nation pair <a href=#>announced their engagement after more than two years</a> together, writing, “I’ve loved you three summers now, honey, and I want ‘em all.”</p><p>Heringer and Erb met while filming season 7 of <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> in 2021. After sharing a mutual connection, things started to get rocky as the reality series continued to play out on screen. Erb subsequently called it quits <a href=#>while cameras were still rolling and the duo left Mexico solo.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bachelor-Nation-s-Abigail-Heringer-and-Noah-Erb-Celebrate-Their-Engagement-Now-Let-s-Get-Hitched-391.jpg><p>The costars, however, were able to work things out privately and announced their reconciliation the night of the season finale. “You never know what you have until it’s gone, then you never let it go,” Erb wrote via Instagram in October 2021. “World, meet my new GF, turns out we do know how to talk to each other and I think I’ll keep her.”</p><p>Erb later defended their decision to rekindle their romance off screen, telling Us Weekly in June 2022, “I think it made it more real. You step away — no cameras, no production, just you and somebody you like that were in a crazy experience in the real world. I think it’s good. It makes it more real. You get to say, ‘OK, where am I at in real life with my own thoughts and my own time?’ And all that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Heringer, meanwhile, <a href=#>reflected on the lessons she learned from finding love</a> on Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>“I think that was kind of where I hit a lot of walls was either trying to control too much or being too resistant to certain things,” she explained. “And obviously that, like, didn’t work out for me. So I think just being as open, like, if you’re gonna take all the time and be vulnerable and be there you have to be open to it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WalmqyZpLu0ecCboKCZmaF6qbHRoqWgnaJiu7Ctx2acq5pdlr%2BmedGemJ2xXam8brPErWShoaSYtaawjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./behind-the-scenes-20-details-only-a-true-fan-knows-about-the-lord-of-the-rings-films.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Behind The Scenes: 20 Details Only A True Fan Knows About The Lord Of The Rings Films</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./avalon-lurks-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-13773-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Avalon Lurks Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
