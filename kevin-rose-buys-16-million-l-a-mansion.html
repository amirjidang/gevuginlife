He also served as production assistant and co-host at TechTV's The Screen Savers. From 2012 to 2015, he was a venture partner at GV, Kevin Rose , who isn’t quite a household name but has been a notable tech entrepreneur for nearly two decades. The California native, 45, first came to prominence in the mid-aughts thanks to his popular Digg website. The success of that now-defunct site and other early internet endeavors led Rose’s transformation into a venture capitalist, and he became a very early investor in a number of major tech companies that are now worth billions — Twitter, Zynga and Square among them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Kevin Rose Net Worth</b></a></span></p><p>Who, who knew owls were so popular? The art world’s latest craze is <a href=#><i>Moonbirds</i></a>, a collection of 10,000 owl avatars that are also non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Ethereum-based project launched earlier this year and almost instantly sold out, generating revenues of $445 million in a matter of days and later swooping up $50 million in a Series A funding round led by venture capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>For most of the last decade, Rose has lived primarily in Portland, Ore., where in 2020 he completed construction on a very glassy custom home. But with the burgeoning success of Moonbirds and his Proof web3 umbrella company, it’s perhaps no surprise that he’s looking toward Los Angeles to grow what he describes as a “big, massive, brand new kind of media company,” according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Records show Rose has paid $16.5 million for an unfinished estate in prime Brentwood Park, one of L.A.’s most expensive neighborhoods. Set behind gates on a half-acre lot, the long and very L-shaped house is still midway through construction, meaning Rose likely won’t be moving in for at least another year. Renderings additionally reveal the contemporary house will offer walls of glass overlooking grassy lawns, plus six bedrooms and 8.5 baths in 7,600 square feet of living space.</p><p>Rose is guaranteed to love that new Brentwood mansion, because his just-sold Portland home looks almost exactly the same. Custom built to his specifications and located in the unincorporated Dunthorpe neighborhood, the sleek residence offers soaring ceilings, walls of glass, five bedroom suites and open-concept living areas throughout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other amenities within the nearly 7,000-square-foot Oregon house (below) are not limited to a “secret” wet bar, gym with sauna, wine cellar, home theater, three-car garage with EV chargers and top-of-the-line security system. No wonder the house hit the market this July and sold in just one month for $7.9 million, nearly the full $8 million asking price.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Moonbirds</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaknaaeu26%2BzqycZpqlrsBufZVmpKKknJ68r3nLZphmpZGjwKq7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashians-ex-business-partner-says-kimoji-app-ruined-his-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashians Ex-Business Partner Says Kimoji App Ruined His Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julie-brangstrup-husband-mark-brangstrup-watts-who-is-maximillion-coopers-ex-wife-married-to-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julie Brangstrup Husband Mark Brangstrup Watts: Who Is Maximillion Coopers Ex Wife Married To Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
