She got into the spotlight when she was spotted several times with the All-Star NBA player. Her Instagram numbers blew up as their relationship grew and in the course of time, the relationship transitioned into a marriage that has seen to the birth of children. So who is Kiara Morrison? In this article, we will explore who the beautiful lady is.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-kiara-morrison-%e2%80%93-demar-derozans-wife></span><strong>Who is Kiara Morrison – Demar Derozan’s Wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kiara Morrison was born on the 18th of January, 1988 in Compton, California. She holds an American nationality but is half-Filipino. She went to the University of South California. Her sister, Courtney Jaco, also went to the same college. Kiara got into the limelight when she got engaged with DeMar DeRozan Demar, whom she met when he played for the USC Trojans; the men’s basketball team for her alma mater.</p><p>Coincidentally, DeMar was a student of USC at the same time as her. They became attracted to each other and both had a passion for basketball. Soon after meeting, they began a relationship and not long afterward, they started dating. Kiara is known to be obsessed with basketball and has been spotted several times yelling out during matches that she watches live.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=here-are-facts-you-need-to-know></span><strong>Here are Facts You Need to Know</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>1. On and Off Relationship</strong></h4><p>At the beginning of the 2017/18 season, it was reported that Kiara and DeMar had split. This was a bit of a shock, as things seemed to be going well between the two of them. Despite the breaking off of things, Kiara took to Instagram to let her followers know that she still maintained a healthy bond with DeMar. Soon afterwards, the post was deleted, with no explanation whatsoever as to their affairs nor as to why there was a breakup in the first place. Later in the year around September 2018, the pair were spotted moving together, leading to speculations that they had got back together.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-children></span><strong>2. Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kiara Morrison has two daughters with the National Basketball Association star. Their first daughter, Diar was born in 2013. At a press conference in 2016, she interrupted her father to tell everyone at the conference “I love my daddy.” Before that day, she appeared in an Instagram video asking everyone to vote her father for a spot at the All-Star Game.</p><p>Their second daughter, Mari, was born in 2016, a little after DeRozan won gold with Team USA at the Summer Olympic games held in Rio de Janeiro. In November of the same year, Kiara Morrison used her Instagram profile to pay tribute to her two daughters, remarking on how much they had changed her life while gushing over them. She expressed herself by saying she didn’t understand the type of love it was until she had her first daughter, and then had her second. She used the same post to thank her mother for showing her how to love her kids and make things work despite the circumstances.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-her-father-was-a-basketball-player></span><strong>3. Her Father was a Basketball Player</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Keith Morrison, Kiara Morrison’s father, played in the Philippine Basketball Association for the Alaska team in the late 1980s. Little wonder Kiara is so obsessed with the sport as a whole. The team started out as the Alaska Milkmen in 1986 but is currently called the Alaska Aces. The team is owned by Alaska Milk Corporation, which makes milk products in the Philippines.</p><p>He was a member of the 1986 inaugural season and helped the team reach the quarterfinals of the All-Filipino Conference and Open Conference. Before he started playing in the Philippines, Keith Morrison attended Washington State University.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-she-went-to-manila-in-2014></span><strong>4. She Went to Manila in 2014</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In July 2014, DeRozan was chosen to represent the NBA in the Philippines. He participated in a basketball clinic with NBA Cares. Kiara followed him on the trip. It was the first time she’d ever been to the Philippines, despite being half-Filipino.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5-37-million-worth-estate></span><strong>5. $3.7 Million Worth Estate</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>DeRozan paid for an estate in Tarzana, California to the tune of $3.7 million in September 2014. The house is reported to have 7 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, a media room, kitchen with double island, office, living room, fireplace, and a large formal dining area. The entire estate covers 6,609 square feet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ykoJqqkWK6sL7Roqqopl2Zsq6t0Wabnqqfr66vv4ywoJ%2BdXZ2ys7GMmqmeZZaWsLW%2FjLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marlon-brando-children-net-worth-will.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Marlon Brando Basically Cut His Children Out Of His Will</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ike-barinholtz-wife-erica-hanson-everything-about-the-producer-spouse-of-after-the-party-actor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Ike Barinholtz Wife Erica Hanson?
