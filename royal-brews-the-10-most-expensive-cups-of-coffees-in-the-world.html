The market for instant coffee has skyrocketed to over $36.3 billion by 2020 and continues to soar even today. <a href=#>A global multi-million dollar business, it contains caffeine that offers a fresh aroma and boosts the brain</a>.</p><p>A typical cup of coffee may cost between $2-$5. However, some coffee beans are cultivated and made in limited numbers with a unique process that hikes their price during retail purchase. Some rarest beans are sold at auctions and undergo unique harvesting that makes a regular drink like coffee a delicacy. From the lands of Central America to the island of Hawaii, coffee is consumed and cultivated everywhere around the world with equal enthusiasm. Let’s take a look at the most expensive cups of coffee globally.</p><h2 id=finca-el-injerto-15>Finca El Injerto ($15)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grown in the Guatemalan region of Central America, Finca El Injerto is cultivated at a high altitude, 5,500 feet above sea level. The coffee exclusively comes from a single farm of coffee on a land that used to be a sugarcane plot, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Manual</a>. Each coffee cup costs $15, and the micro-lots of the coffee are usually sold at auctions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Coffees In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=fazenda-santa-in-s-19>Fazenda Santa Inês ($19)</h2><p>Costing $19 for a single cup, Fazenda Santa Inês is located in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais near the Mantiqueira mountains. The bright and sweet coffee has hints of clove and lemons. <a href=#>The topography and harvesting of the coffee</a> are done by hand, ensuring that the quality does not drop, making it one of the most expensive coffee cups on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=molokai-coffee-25>Molokai Coffee ($25)</h2><p>A Hawaiian coffee on the list, Molokai coffee, comes from a smaller island of the same name. Coffee was discovered in the 1800s in Molokai but did not become commercial until the 1980s. The bean called the red catuai grows on the volcanic soils, which give it a sharper taste and falls on the heavier roast spectrum, costing $25.</p><h2 id=starbucks-quadriginoctuple-frappuccino-47-30>Starbucks Quadriginoctuple Frappuccino ($47.30)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, a man visited Starbucks in Enumclaw, Washington, and ordered himself the most expensive Starbucks drink until that year. He celebrated his 27th birthday by ordering a Quadriginoctuple Frappuccino that included forty espresso shots, two bananas, protein powder, soy, caramel drizzle, Frappuccino chips, and vanilla beam, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>. The total came to around $50; however, Starbucks gave it for free as it was his birthday.</p><h2 id=black-ivory-coffee-cup-50>Black Ivory Coffee Cup ($50)</h2><p>Nothing with the word ivory has ever been cheap, not even a cup of coffee. The black ivory coffee cup has beans hailing from the land of Northern Thailand. The harvesting process is not delicious as the beans go through an elephant's digestive tract before they are released into enzymes so they can become smooth and delicious.</p><h2 id=hacienda-la-esmeralda-55>Hacienda la Esmeralda ($55)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>One of the most awarded coffee on the list, Hacienda la Esmeralda</a>, has won many accolades over the past two decades and is considered a once-in-a-lifetime experience for coffee lovers.

The pam civets consume the coffee cherries, which were fermented during their digestion process. The enzyme secreted during the process offers a different flavor to the coffee, and the extremely rare cup costs a whopping $100.</p><h2 id=elida-geisha-natural-1029-100>Elida Geisha Natural 1029 ($100)</h2><p>Klatch Coffee Roasters in San Francisco served one of the most expensive coffee cups worth $100, made from the costly beans of Elida Geisha Natural 1029, which costs $1,029 per pound. It is a part of the fourth wave of specialty coffee that has taken over in 2020. The coffee is exclusive, and only 1,600 cups are available around the globe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=super-venti-flat-white-148-99>Super Venti Flat White ($148.99)</h2><p><a href=#>Starbucks introduced the Most Expensive Starbucks Drink Challenge in 2017.</a> When William E.
