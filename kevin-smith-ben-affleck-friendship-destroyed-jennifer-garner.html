Unsurprisingly, once the Alias actress was no longer controlling who Aflleck could be friends with, he and Smith rekindled their friendship. It started when the Batman actor began making cameos again in his friend’s films. In 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck returned to acting with his friend by making a cameo in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.</a></p><p>“I actually felt like Reboot was the new beginning of a beautiful friendship. It was like, ‘Oh, we’re back. Now I can reach out to Ben anytime.”</p><p>Ben Affleck also appeared in Kevin Smith’s 2022 film, Clerks III, and reportedly spent time with the director on set. “We spent more time bullsh**ting than we did actually making the movie.
