In an <a href=#>exclusive interview with Daily Mail</a>, David Liebensohn, a software developer who helped create the Kimoji app, claims that partnering with Kim left him in financial ruin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The app was a huge hit when it debuted in December 2015. At one point, it was getting thousands of downloads per second and making $1 million in profits a minute.</p><p>However, Liebensohn say that “misunderstandings” with the reality star eventually forced him out of the app, courtesy of her lawyer Marty Singer. After being pressured to sign his rights away, Liebensohn says he's missed out on millions in profits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West’s Presidential Campaign Paid Nick Fuentes Over $30,000</a></span></p><p>Liebensohn went on to file a $300 million lawsuit against Kim in 2019 over the situation, however, the case was later rejected by an LA Superior Court judge.</p><p>"She is a bully," <a href=#>he said of Kim at the time</a> . "She stole my life's work. No one should have to go through what I have in the past four and a half years since I met her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Liebensohn is determined to make his side of the story public so he can shed light on Kim’s alleged business ethics.</p><p>Liebensohn went on to claim that fighting against Kim has left him financially drained – to the point where he’s had to sleep in his car. But Liebensohn remains hopeful that he may seem some of the profits from the Kimoji app one day.</p><p>So far, Kim hasn’t responded to Liebensohn’s recent accusations. But this is hardly the first time Kim has faced <a href=#>backlash over one of her businesses</a>.</p><p>Over a decade ago, Kim launched Kardashian Beauty alongside her sisters, Kourtney and Khloe, but they got into a dispute with their business partners over money. The case was finally settled in 2021, with the Kardashians walking away with $11.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim was also sued in 2022 alongside her mom and several of her sisters by Blac Chyna, who shares a daughter with Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian.</p><p>Chyna blamed the family for the cancellation of her reality show Rob & Chyna, leading her to file a $100 million lawsuit. The entire case was eventually dismissed. Though Chyna has vowed to appeal the case, she’s yet to do so.</p><p>Kim is also involved in an ongoing lawsuit alongside her sister Kylie Jenner, which was filed in 2020 by Seed Beauty, who blames the sisters and their business partner Coty Inc. of misappropriating trade secrets.</p><p>Needless to say, Kim is familiar with accusations and lawsuits when it comes to her businesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Hailey Bieber Rocks $6,000 Diamond & Gold Body Chain To Coachella</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>Nylon</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzaxknrBdl8K0tc2eqqxloJa%2FtbrEq2Ssmamoeqy1zKihomWRpb1uvtSipZ6cXZ22tHnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richest-latina-actresses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Latina Powerhouses: Richest Latina Actresses</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-rose-buys-16-million-l-a-mansion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Rose Buys $16 Million L.A.
