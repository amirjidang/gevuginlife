Will they go with something modern, a family name, a classic, or something unique? Lots of parents are going with trendy names or ones we’ve never before heard of – just see what celebs are doing and it’s obvious that there aren’t too many “Plain Janes” being born anymore. Made-up names are the new norm, leaving the “Jennifers” and “Jasons” in the dust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While newer names can be beautiful — perhaps one day becoming classics themselves — there are some old-fashioned names that deserve a warm welcome back. Some parents may feel like these names are over and done with, but once they realize that these classics deserve a do-over, they may just consider naming their baby “Beatrice” or “Barney.”</p><p>Of course, there are still babies today who are being named something from the list below, but the popularity is certainly not on the rise. Perhaps parents-to-be can turn things around for the new generation and swap today’s trends for something timeless.</p><p>Check out these&nbsp;10 girls’ names and&nbsp;10 boys’ names below and realize their potential.</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Girls:</strong></p><h2 id=anita><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Anita</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Anita.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anita is short and sweet, simple, yet interesting at the same time. With a name like Anita, nearly any middle or last name will go along with it well, making it universally appealing. For the music fans out there, Anita Baker is a prime example of a classy woman who wears the name well. Plus, there’s something powerful about naming a baby with the first letter of the alphabet, giving her a head start as #1. If an “A” name is on your must-have list, Anita is an amazing girls’ name to go with.</p><h2 id=beatrice><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Beatrice</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Beatrice.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beatrice may not sound like the best baby name at first, since we are so used to hearing it as an older woman’s name. But let’s not forget, those old ladies were once babies too, and baby Beatrice is a beautiful thing. Parents can call their precious baby “Bea,” short, simple, and oh-so-sweet. Once moms and dads give this classic name some thoughtful consideration, it’s sure to grow on them. As far as “B” names go, Beatrice is a beautiful one. Baby Bea is definitely buzzworthy!</p><h2 id=bessie><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Bessie</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bessie.jpg><p>Another “B” name that deserves a comeback is Bessie. Adorable as can be, this simple name is well-known, but hardly used anymore. There are plenty of elderly women walking around with the name, but for some reason, it just hasn’t stood the test of time. Let’s give Bessie another chance to become a top name once again. If moms and dads start giving it some well-deserved attention, a whole new generation of Bessies will give those old ladies a lift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dorothy><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Dorothy</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dorothy.jpg><p>Fans of The Wizard of Oz certainly know a thing or two about the name Dorothy, but even the film’s fanatics don’t seem to take the next step and name their baby girl the lead character’s name. Even with the ruby slippers and adorable dog, the name just doesn’t make it to today’s birth certificates. Too bad this pretty name hasn’t made it past the yellow brick road, but today’s parents still have the chance to give it new life. Even the Wicked Witch would approve.</p><h2 id=doris><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Doris</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Doris.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the recent passing of actress Doris Day, the name Doris is back in the spotlight, front and center. We barely hear of a baby being named Doris these days, but perhaps the star’s passing will bring new life to the short but sweet girls’ name. Doris is delightful, a name that is easy to spell and sound out. For fans of the late Day, naming their baby Doris would be a lovely homage to pay the beloved and beautiful celebrity.</p><h2 id=georgia><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Georgia</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Georgia.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweet as a peach, the name Georgia is so adorable, yet too many of today’s moms and dads find it to be old-fashioned. While the U.S. state of the same name is popular, parents today just don’t want to take the extra step and name their baby girls after the spot. Sure, Brooklyn is fine for today’s babies, and the Wests have turned Chicago into a first name, but Georgia seems to be reserved for grannies. New parents should give this gorgeous name another chance; it’s sure to become popular down south.</p><h2 id=gloria><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Gloria</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gloria.jpg><p>The name Gloria is simply glorious, yet today’s new parents are not picking the name for their baby girls. While older women embrace the name with elegance and refinement, new parents aren’t giving their babies a chance to have the same experience. Wouldn’t it be cute for a girl to be nicknamed “Glory?” So impressive and unique, this nickname is sure to become trendy. Gloria is great, it’ll just take a bunch of parents to jump on the bandwagon to make it popular again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joyce><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Joyce</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joyce.jpg><p>Joyce is a one-syllable name that is so simple on one hand, yet quite intricate at the same time. We barely hear it much anymore, yet the name is so joyful and joyous. Moms and dads ought to reconsider this “J” name for their beautiful baby girls. It is a happy-sounding first name that will always bring a smile to their face. They can call their baby “Joy” for short, a feeling that their child already brings to them daily.</p><h2 id=maude><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Maude</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Maude-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maude is so cute, it’s surprising that today’s moms and dads don’t want to give their baby girls this classic name. Sure, it sounds outdated, but once a bunch of proud parents give it a new life, the name will catch on like wildfire. Perhaps some people have a grandmother with the name, so it would have a sentimental meaning when they pass it along to their newborn. It’s all about perspective – what seems old-fashioned to some can be a classic-turned-current once again.</p><h2 id=mildred><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Mildred</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mildred.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mildred is one of those names that screams “old!” But if parents take a second to reconsider their initial reaction, the old-fashioned “M” name may suddenly seem less ancient and more “awe.” Think about it – a parent can give their baby girl the nickname, “Milly,” which is super cute and always current. Classic names are always worth another shot, and if a name like Mildred can make it back into the mainstream, any name can. Who’s ready to give Mildred some love?</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Boys:</strong></p><h2 id=abraham><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Abraham</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Abraham.jpg><p>“Honest Abe” was one of America’s most beloved presidents, but the name is not as popular as one would think it would be. Back in the day, more baby boys were named Abraham, but these days, there are far more Adams and Aidens than Abes. But moms and dads should forget what’s currently popular and pick a name with a rich history and classic feel. They can call their kid “Abe” for short…and let’s hope he is always honest too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barney><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Barney</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barney.jpeg><p>Aside from the big purple dinosaur, the name Barney isn’t a boys’ name that many parents are picking nowadays. Perhaps it’s not as trendy as Brandon or as common as Billy, but Barney has that certain something that’s uncommonly cute and creative. It’s an old-fashioned name but still has a youthful appeal. If only parents would get that goofy giant dinosaur out of their heads, they would realize that one of the best “B” names has been right under their noses the whole time.</p><h2 id=bruce><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Bruce</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bruce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s Bruce Springsteen and Bruce Willis, but where are the baby Bruces of today? The name is strong and simple, yet there is barely a Bruce born today. Fans of the iconic singer and talented actor must think the “B” name sounds charming, yet they are unwilling to take the next step and name their sons after the fellas they are long-time fans of. Let’s give Bruce a shout out and name the boys of the future this familiar name.</p><h2 id=emmanuel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Emmanuel</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Emmanuel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emmanuel is a name we have all heard of, but not too many of us know a young boy with the name. Lots of parents give their son the nickname “Manny,” but the full name is quite lovely and ought to be kept intact, so to speak. There are more common “E” names today’s new parents are opting for, such as Eli, Ethan, and Eric, but Emmanuel is a classic that will never go out of style, so they ought to give it a shot when their son arrives.</p><h2 id=ernest><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Ernest</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ernest.jpg><p>Ernest is certainly not trendy or even childlike, but the name’s a classic and we’re hoping for a comeback. Parents can call their cutie “Ernie,” which has been a Sesame Street favorite for ages. Baby Ernie will love seeing the happy-go-lucky character with the same name on the TV set, making him long for his rubber duckie when it’s time for a bath. While Ernest is not as popular as Evan, it can get there if more moms and dads forget what’s popular and go with their gut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=francis><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Francis</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Francis.jpg><p>Francis can be a name for a boy or a girl, but no matter which gender gets it, the name will always be considered to be old-fashioned. Even if it makes a comeback, people will think of their grandparents or other old folks who share the name. But classics can become popular again as they circle back around, so parents can feel good about choosing Francis for their little fella. “Frankie” is always a fun nickname, so they don’t always have to be so formal. Francis is fabulous; let’s give it a rebirth!</p><h2 id=homer><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Homer</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Homer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Homer is an old-time name, unless the first thing that comes to mind is TV’s Homer Simpson. Sure, Homer isn’t as common as Harry or Henry, but the name is strong, solid, and well-suited for today’s baby boys. Too bad parents don’t list Homer at the top of their list, because the name deserves some attention. If parents are set on an “H” name for their baby boy, Homer is one that will stand out yet sound familiar at the same time.</p><h2 id=martin><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Martin</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Martin.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Martin is a name that has been around forever, and everyone has heard of someone with the name, be it a family member, friend, or famous person. But when it comes time for today’s parents-to-be to pick a name for their son, Martin doesn’t usually come to mind. If they are interested in an “M” name, Michael, Matthew, or Marc is sure to be a frontrunner, while Martin doesn’t even make it to the top 10. Martin can be called “Marty,” a cute nickname for a classic.</p><h2 id=myron><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Myron</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Myron.jpg><p>There are not too many boys named Myron today, but it’s a classic name that can get a reboot if only new parents would give it a go. It only seems old-fashioned because no one’s bringing it back. There are plenty of cool and hip “M” names that parents seem to prefer, like Max, for example, but if Myron were to become the new trending name, it would sound just as modern. Parents who are tired of long-running trends can set their own by naming their baby boy Myron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sylvester><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Sylvester</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sylvester.jpg><p>Sylvester Stallone is an actor we all know and love, but that doesn’t mean today’s parents are giving their baby boys the same first name. Perhaps there’s too much pressure for their sons to grow up to be the next “Rocky” or “Rambo,” or maybe it’s because parents just don’t much care for the name. But Sylvester is something different. They can call their son “Sly” for short, something they must admit sounds adorable. Let’s give Sylvester a fighting chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWepMRuvsCrnGaakZfGbrrAppysZaSdrrV5zZ6cnWWkpHqurcqeZJplk6S6pq7AnKJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-darnell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-528504-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew Darnell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-crazy-fan-theories-on-the-sopranos-you-never-heard-about.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Crazy Fan Theories On The Sopranos You Never Heard About</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
