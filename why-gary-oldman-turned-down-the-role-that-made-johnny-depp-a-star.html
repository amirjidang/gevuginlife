But could you imagine Gary&nbsp;as Edward Scissorhands?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps&nbsp;he would have made this particular beloved movie better than Johnny Depp did. Or perhaps it would've been much worse. Either way, it would have been different and that's not what diehard fans of Edward Scissorhands would have wanted. In every respect, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the unbelievable rich Johnny Depp</a> made this very strange movie a critical darling and one of the most sought-after films of the 1990s. This was something Johnny was absolutely counting on when he signed on to do the film. But back when Gary Oldman read the script, he just didn't see the potential that Johnny Depp clearly did.</p><h2 id=the-real-reason-gary-oldman-turned-down-edward-scissorhands>The Real Reason Gary Oldman Turned Down Edward Scissorhands</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Larry King</a> in 2016, Gary Oldman went into detail about his career and the minor regrets he's had along the way. One of the most interesting questions asked had to do with the roles that Gary had turned down. When asked this kind of question, actors tend to be very cagey. This is because they don't want to come across as rude to the actors who took the roles. That and the fact that they don't want audience members to compare them. But, in the interview, Gary actually was honest about one specific role that he turned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Ever regret anything you've turned down?" Larry King asked Gary, who sat alongside Kevin Costner in the interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Was Gary Oldman And David Bowie's Relationship Like?</a></span></p><p>"I've turned a few things down. I can't say I 'regret'. But I couldn't mention them," Gary explained. "I can tell you one story, that they were interested in me, many years ago, for Edward Scissorhands."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"And I read the script and I went, 'This is ridiculous. A castle at the end of this road and then an Avon lady comes around selling makeup and this kid's got scissor-hands. This is nuts! I don't get this at all.' And I ended up not doing it. I don't think I even went for a meeting. I just said [to my agents that] 'It's not for me. I don't get it.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-role-that-made-johnny-depp-a-star>The Role That Made Johnny Depp A Star</h2><p>Of course, many fans of Edward Scissorhands are happy that Gary Oldman didn't want the role of Edward Scissorhands. This is not because Gary isn't a good actor. On the contrary, he is easily one of the best actors of his generation. But Edward Scissorhands was a role seemingly made for Johnny Depp. Not only that but there's also no doubt that Edward Scissorhands made Johnny Depp an A-list star.</p><p>At that point in his career, Johnny Depp was a mainstay on 21 Jump Street. He also had a number of smaller roles in big projects such as Platoon and A Nightmare On Elm Street. However, after Edward Scissorhands came out, his career skyrocketed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things that most fans may not know about Edward Scissorhands </a>was that Johnny really wanted the role. He wanted it because, at the time, he was mostly known as a teen idol. This serious and visually unappealing role would break him out of that. But Johnny also knew that he was up against every actor of his generation. Little did he know that Gary Oldman was among his competition. All of the attention on the casting of the movie caused Johnny to not even want to try auditioning for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Scissorhands Turns 30: 10 Things You Didn't Know About The Cult Classic</a></span></p><p>In an interview with SBIFF, Johnny credited his agent for pushing him to take the meeting with director Tim Burton. When Johnny and Tim actually met, the two instantly hit it off and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim decided to hire Johnny</a> soon after.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Johnny Depp And Penelope Cruz Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Funnily, however, Johnny could have completely missed the meeting with Tim for another reason. He actually had absolutely no idea what Tim looked like when he strolled into the coffee shop where they were supposed to meet. But once he saw the man sitting in the corner with hair like he was caught in 'an explosion at a hardware store' and chewing his spoon, he figured that was Tim.</p><p>Of course, Johnny being cast in Edward Scissorhands also kickstarted his&nbsp;ongoing working <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship and friendship with Tim Burton</a>.</p><p>Soon after Edward Scissorhands was released, Johnny was cast in Benny & Joon, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and Donnie Brasco. In short, his career was on an incredible upward trajectory. A lot of this had to do with the fact that critics adored Edward Scissorhands and it had a really decent reaction among the mainstream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, this begs the question...</p><h2 id=did-gary-oldman-finally-realize-what-he-missed-out-on>Did Gary Oldman Finally Realize What He Missed Out On?</h2><p>The short answer is... 'yes'... Gary finally understood why Edward Scissorhands was great when he actually sat down to watch it in a movie theater.</p><p>"I got and see the movie and the camera pans over these multi-colored houses in this very sort of suburban neighborhood and then you see this sort of Dracula castle on the hill," Gary explained Larry King and Kevin Costner. "Literally two minutes [in to the movie] I went, 'Yeah, I get it.' I got it. I just got it too late."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What David Fincher, Gary Oldman And Donya Fiorentino Have In Common</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnK6zxYyoo52lkaN6tcHRp5ydZZSkxK9506GcZqqfobJuwMeaq2alkZmybrbOoaWnsV2ZsrG8jJpkrKyRp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zara-larsson-net-worth-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zara Larsson Net Worth How Much is Zara Larsson Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-alexis-bledel-husband-filed-for-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Alexis Bledel's Husband Of Eight Years Filed For Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
