Even before landing the lead role in Legacies, the now 23-year-old was getting viciously body-shamed on social media.</p><p>At this point, the Aloha star was more than willing to clap back at the critics. “It’s extremely upsetting that people are calling me unworthy, a bad actress, or degrading me because I have curves,” she wrote on Instagram in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/did-danielle-rose-russell-quit-acting-after-legacies-ended-and-she-vanished-from-instagram_.jpg><p>“I don’t need to explain myself to anyone, but those who are body-shaming me should be ashamed of themselves for calling me unworthy of being an actress, and are only hurting other young women and men who don’t have a body up to your standards.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How The Vampire Diaries' Joseph Morgan's Role In Titans Is Not Much Different Than Klaus</a></span></p><p>Though hordes of adoring fans came out in solidarity with the actress, this wouldn’t be the last time the internet trolls would attack.

It comes from a good place, of course. But there’s so many times like right now I’m at this place in my career where I am auditioning, and I am pursuing things, but nothing is fixed right now,” she said. “I really wanted to give myself time. I took a month and I traveled a little bit, and I spent some time with friends and family like I said. And that’s enough for me right now, I just got off a five-year thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though yet to step away from the acting scene, the Aloha star is yet to land her next big role. As it turns out, the 23-year-old has encountered some hurdles in the audition process, a fact she didn't shy away from admitting during her interview with The Unscene Work podcast.</p><p>“Facing rejection is probably one of the toughest parts of being an actor,” she said. “The part that really no one sees is how much rejection you face… I’ve literally felt heartbroken over the roles that I’ve lost in films or projects that I’ve lost. It’s broken my heart for a period of time. That’s really difficult, dealing with that. I still face that to this day. I’ve been going through it, I got off of my show about six months ago, and I focused a lot on myself personally, and my life personally, and I’m just getting back into auditioning now, and I’m remembering the whole process, and its more rejection than acceptance, and that’s hard to readjust to again.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdma6vtcSlo55loqTApnnRrqqsnZyherLByK1kmpuknruoecCfq56qXaGyqK3CopysZZWjsaawjK%2BYp6GjnbKlecWrpqZlmaPAta3Gq5imZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-ian-rossborough-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-77377-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Ian Rossborough Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./denny-hamlin-wife-or-girlfriend-is-he-married-to-jordan-fish-age-net-worth-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Denny Hamlin Wife Or Girlfriend: Is He Married To Jordan Fish?
