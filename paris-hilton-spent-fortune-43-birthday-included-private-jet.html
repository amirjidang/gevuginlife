The average <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chanel bag can vary between $3,350-$11,500</a>, meaning the mother-of-two’s present alone likely had a thousand dollar price tag.</p><p>While the birthday decoration alone likely racked up a big bill (the interior wage of a celebrity <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">party planner can average between $15,000 to $20,000</a>), it was probably Paris’ private jet that cost the most to rent out for the b-day celebrations. One report says a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private jet can cost $2,000 to $14,000 per hour</a> to rent – the price tends to increase depending on the air craft.</p><p>"Another sparkling year of pure #Sliving!
