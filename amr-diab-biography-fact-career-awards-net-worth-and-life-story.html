His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation and was the chairman of Marine Construction & Shipbuilding in the canal. Diab’s father played a huge role in igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab’s early stages in his professional music career. Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the Egyptian National Anthem “Bilady, Bilady, Bilady” at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally. Diab graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><span id=Career>Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Diab released his first album entitled <i>Ya Tareeq</i> in 1983.

Amr played himself in his first film, <i>El Afareet</i>, which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film <i>Ice Cream in Gleam</i> (<i>Ays Krim fi Glym</i>), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive’s new program “Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films” at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the <i>Los Angeles Weekly</i> termed it “observant” and “a big leap”. His third movie was released in 1993, and was named <i>Deahk We La’ab</i> (<i>Laughter and Fun</i>). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star Omar Sharif (<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>) and Yousra. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=egyptian-revolution></span><span id=Egyptian_Revolution>Egyptian Revolution</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the 2011 uprising, some protesters criticized Diab for staying silent, and for fleeing Egypt for London. A few days after former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, “Masr A’let” (Egypt Said), and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the uprising. He initiated a charity campaign “Masry Begad” (“Truly Egyptian”), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what the Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amr-diab-in-movies></span><span id=Amr_Diab_in_movies>Amr Diab in movies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amr Diab’s songs have appeared in several films, including:</p><ul><li>“Wala Ala Baloh” in <i>Divine Intervention</i> (2002)</li><li>“Awedouni” in <i>The Dancer Upstairs</i> (2002)</li><li>“El Alem Alah” and “Nour El Ain” in <i>O Clone</i> (2001)</li><li>“Nafs El Makan” in <i>Double Whammy</i> (2001)</li><li>“Tamally Ma’ak” and “Nour El Ain” in the French movie, <i>Coco</i> (2009)</li><li>“Nour El Ain” in <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i> TV series (Season 4, Episode 4, Episode name: Stupid Girl), released on 9 January 2000 (USA)</li><li>“Wala Ala Baloh” in <i>The Dictator</i> (2012)</li></ul><ul><li id=cite_note-1><span><b></b></span> <span class=reference-text>“Soundtracks for Yadon ilaheyya”.
