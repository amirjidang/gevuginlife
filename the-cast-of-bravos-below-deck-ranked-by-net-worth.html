The show has since had a number of spin-offs, including Below Deck Med and Sailing Yacht. With Captain Lee Rosbach and Captain Sandy Yawn being the longest-running cast members, fans always assumed they were the richest Below Deck cast members. Well, while Lee's $800,000 net worth and Sandy's $400,000 net worth, it's actually Chef Ben Robinson that takes the take with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his $2.5 million net worth!</a> Hannah Ferrier also comes out on top with an impressive net worth of $600,000, which will certainly come in handy after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having just given birth</a> a few months ago.</p><h2 id=kat-held---100-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kat Held - $100,000</span></h2><p>Kat Held was certainly a respected crew member on the hit series, Below Deck. Her career out at sea first began back in Maimi, Florida when she snagged her first role as a yacht stewardess. While fans loved Kat, it appears as if she did not love the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star remained a full-time cast member for two seasons before calling it quits. She went on to reveal that she'd be leaving yachting behind for good and moved back home to Rhode Island. Despite her leaving the industry, Kat managed to earn herself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $100,000.</a></p><h2 id=rhylee-gerber---100-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rhylee Gerber - $100,000</span></h2><p>Rhylee Gerber made for the perfect addition to Below Deck! The star made her love for fishing and commercial fishing boats clear from on the show, a passion she developed from a young age.</p><p>Prior to her time on Bravo, Gerber appeared on the reality show, The Last Frontier, making it clear that she was no stranger to the cameras. During her time with Bravo, Rhylee earned $20,000 per episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassing a net worth of $100,000.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashton-pienaar-150-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ashton Pienaar $150,000</span></h2><p>Ashton Pienaar made his Below Deck debut during its sixth season on Below Deck: Seanna. It became clear that he and fellow co-star, Kate Chastain, would not get along, which was evident during the show's reunion at the Bravo Clubhouse. During his time on the show, Pienaar developed quite the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">budding romance with fellow cast member, Ross Inia.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Below Deck’: Everything Hannah Ferrier Has Been Up To Since Her Firing</a></span></p><p>The two bonded over their love for sports, and adventure, which made their time out at sea that much better. While Ashton may no longer be on the show, he managed to earn decent pay, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassing a net worth of $150,000.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-chastain---300-000><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kate Chastain - $300,000</span></h2><p>Kate Chastain is easily one of the biggest names attached to the Bravo series. She first began at the very start of the show as the lead stewardess and one that didn't put up with anything! Chastain remained on board for six seasons before announcing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would be leaving the show for good.</a></p><p>In addition to stepping down from Below Deck, Kate also revealed that she'd be leaving Bravo's Chat Room, making it clear that she's no longer about that Bravo life. Despite her absence, Kate managed to make quite the name for herself, and if that weren't enough, she's also earned herself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $300,000.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-sandy-yawn---400-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Captain Sandy Yawn - $400,000</span></h2><p>Much like Captain Lee Rosbach, Captain Sandy Yawn is not only a fan favorite but loved by Bravo exec, Andy Cohen. Sandy has worked in a freelancing capacity at sea for over three decades, making her quite the expert.</p><p>As a yacht captain, [aroculal on Below Deck, the star has dealt with a number of situations that make her as great as she is, especially when it comes to putting up with her crew. Luckily for Captain Sandy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the star has her $400,000 net worth</a> to fall back on if she ever chooses to leave the show for good. While Sandy ruffled some feathers following Hannah Ferrier's firing, she appears to be redeeming herself on the current season of Below Deck Med.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hannah-ferrier---600-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hannah Ferrier - $600,000</span></h2><p>Considering the success of Bravo's original Below Deck series, it was only fitting for the network to introduced fans to Hannah Ferrier, who became the Chief Yacht Stewardess in the reality series spin-off, Below Deck: Mediterranean.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Below Deck': What Is Chef Adrian Doing Now?</a></span></p><p>The Aussie-born star has become a fan favorite, mostly because of her bubbly and sweet personality. Despite her kind ways, Ferrier is also the last person you'd want to upset! Luckily for the star, her success in the series has allowed her to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amass a net worth of $600,000.</a> Since her firing last season on Below Deck Med, Hannah has moved back to Australia where she and her hubby have started their family!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-mark-howard---800-000><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Captain Mark Howard - $800,000</span></h2><p>Captain Mark Howard first appeared on Below Deck's first season, however, that would be the last time fans would see him. While his departure may have come off as sudden, fans immediately fell in love with Howard's replacement, Captain Sandy.</p><p>During his time on the show, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark was bringing in between $120,000 to $180,000 annually</a>, which is quite similar to that of Captain Lee. Considering the duo have been in the game for the same amount of time, it is only fitting to assume that Captain Mark's net worth is similar to that of Lee Rosbach's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-lee-rosbach---800-000><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Captain Lee Rosbach - $800,000</span></h2><p>Captain Lee Rosbach is certainly the most loved Below Deck cast member. The captain is by no means a pushover and has no problem speaking his mind, especially when it comes to rules on his ship.</p><p>As someone who charters yachts, it is no surprise that the esteemed out at sea captain has amassed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an impressive net worth of $800,000</a>, which was certainly made possible from his estimates $95,000 - $130,000 annual salary, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>. Captain Lee has just welcomed yet another grandchild earlier this month, baby Amelia Charlotte.</p><h2 id=eddie-lucas---1-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Eddie Lucas - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eddie Lucas appeared on the very first season of Below Deck, however, he only lasted up until the series third season. During his time on the show, the star stirred up quite a lot of drama, especially when it comes to his romance.</p><p>He began dating co-star, Rocky Dakota, however, he did so all while having a girlfriend back home. Despite his wrongdoings, Eddie was a stellar sea crew member, which makes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his $1 million net worth</a> a fitting figure for his level of adventure expertise.</p><h2 id=ben-robinson---2-5-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ben Robinson - $2.5 Million</span></h2><p>Ben Robinson joined the cast of Below Deck as none other than the mastermind behind some of the most delicious meals the crew has served to its guests. While his time on the show has certainly helped him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amass his $2.5 million net worth</a>, he has had quite the culinary career prior to his time on-camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robinson received his cooking skills back in Florence, Italy before becoming a chef on the Athena, the world's biggest cruise line. In addition to his talents in the kitchen, Ben is also a certified health and lifestyle coach, which also contributes to his growing worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>‘Below Deck Med’ Fans React To Chef Quitting Midseason & The Second Stew Assaulting A Deckhand</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWaaopbDsL%2BMm5ylp6disaavymapmqabmrFurthmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./community-cast-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Community Cast, Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-conditioner-bar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Conditioner Bar of 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
