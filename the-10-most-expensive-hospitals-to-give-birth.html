They want what's best for their newborn baby and for themselves, so it's only natural that they choose the best service out there. News flash: having a baby is not cheap. Giving life proves quite expensive. That precious bundle of joy can come with a jaw-dropping hospital bill. The average hospital delivery in the U.S. costs between $10,000 and $15,000. That's a fortune for most of us and it's a lot more than in any other developed country out there. Delivery costs tripled in the U.S. since 1996. Talk about inflation! Even those who benefit from maternity coverage still have various expenses to cover. What's really ironic is that the U.S. has some of the highest infant and maternal death rates in first-world countries. In this case, choosing between private and public hospitals may not be such a tough decision to make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay Z</a> and <a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce</a>'s Blue Ivy was delivered in the most luxurious surroundings, setting new trends. When the rich and famous give birth, their hospital stay can easily be compared to a pampering spa getaway. Forget all about that tasteless hospital food and roommates. You'll be introduced to your very own private suite, five star rooms reading luxury allover. However, celebrities and royals are not the only ones seeking deluxe accommodation and medical services. Anyone with the right amount of cash can choose a posh place to deliver in style in A-list maternity suites, benefiting from stellar obstetric care, giving birth like a superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-prince-of-wales-hospital-in-sydney-1-000-per-day><b>10. Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney: $1,000 Per Day</b></h2><p>Australia is considered one of the best places on Earth not just to be born, but also to be raised. The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney set up a luxury maternity unit in the adjacent Crowne Plaza Coogee Beach, a five-star hotel. Of course, your stay will be billed accordingly. The best doctors in Sydney offer premium maternity services while you are being pampered in style in a private ocean-view suite. Mothers are offered limousine rides to and from the hospital. Not too shabby, although, the accommodation is not nearly as expensive as the delivery fees, which can get close to $10,000 if you require a C-section.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-clinique-des-grangettes-in-switzerland-2-140-per-night><b>9. Clinique des Grangettes in Switzerland: $2,140 Per Night</b></h2><p>The small country in the heart of Europe takes pride in its clean air and good quality of living. Renowned throughout the world for its immaculate medical care and services, many women decide to travel to Switzerland during their final weeks of pregnancy in order to benefit from the flawless child delivery services here. The average price is $4,000 for a natural birth without medical complications. Clinique des Grangettes in Geneva is set in a lovely park offering calming views from its windows. It is the most popular private clinic in all of Switzerland. Among the many services they offer, they take pride in a chef with a Michelin star offering 24-hour room service to your own private room. Giving birth at Clinique des Grangettes will feel like a pampering holiday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-lenox-hill-hospital-in-manhattan-2-500-per-day><b>8. Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan: $2,500 Per Day</b></h2><p>Now even more famous after the birth of Blue Ivy, Mr. and Mrs. Jay-Z's little bundle of joy, Lenox Hill Hospital offers luxurious suites with mahogany walls, hardwood floors, luxurious linens, its own kitchenette, and even a concierge that can arrange anything from a stylish hairdo to manicure, pedicure, and massage. You do want to look your best when delivering your precious little baby, right? Headlines told us the couple dropped $1.3 million to rent the entire floor in preparation for the delivery of their daughter. However, the hospital's director denied the rumors, claiming that the stars were accommodated in an executive suite and were billed the standard rate.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-cedars-sinai-los-angeles-4-000-per-day><b>7.

For “just” $4,000 per day, you get the Deluxe Maternity Package, a three-room suite with two bathrooms. Forget all about that nasty hospital food. Your menu will include plenty of fresh fruit, muffins, and chilled juices, fit for the queen you are. Plus, they offer bedside salon services, like hairstylist, manicures, and pedicures. After all, who wants to leave the hospital looking like they've just had a baby?

Mount Sinai Hospital in New York: $4,000 Per Day</b></h2><p>If you want a room with a view, look no more. The luxury suites of Mount Sinai Hospital offer a stunning view of Central Park and Manhattan. However, that's not the only reason <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and <a title="Sean Combs – Diddy Net Worth" href=#>P. Diddy</a> chose Mount Sinai for the birth of their children. Think blankets made from Muslin cotton and massage therapy to relieve the pain and stress. Add bathrooms with Italian glass tiles and tea and cookies served in the afternoons. The exclusive Klingenstein Pavilion of Mount Sinai Hospital on Fifth Avenue offers luxurious multi-room birthing suites with spa-inspired bathrooms that guarantee a full pampering experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-rose-medical-center-in-denver-3-450-for-a-physical><b>5.

Plus, after giving birth, mothers can check into one of the center's six luxury suites, where their taste buds will be pampered by a private chef. One of America's most luxurious places to give birth, Rose Medical Center in Denver Colorado offers an enhanced level of comfort, featuring amenities similar to a hotel suite. The boutique-style medical practice charges $3,450 just for a physical. The price per room is not disclosed, but we can only imagine.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-chelsea-amp-westminster-hospital-in-london-10-000-per-birth><b>4. Chelsea & Westminster Hospital in London: $10,000 Per Birth</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kensigton Wing of the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital in London was specially designed for all those mothers seeking intimacy and exclusive care. They charge an average $10,000 per natural delivery, which includes a one night stay in one of their private rooms in the private Kensington Wing. If the mother requires a C-section, the price is $13,300, including the first night's stay. All consultant fees are billed separately, and there are many other fees to consider. For example, ward attendance will get you at about $1,000 a day. That's a lot of money, considering that the average child delivery fee in the United Kingdom is $2,641. However, services do include champagne breakfast and moms can even choose their delivery room's drape color.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-st-mary-s-hospital-in-london-15-000-per-private-suite><b>3. St. Mary's Hospital in London: $15,000 Per Private Suite</b></h2><p>Recently, St. Mary's Hospital in London has become the closest you can get to feeling and being treated like royalty. The Duchess of Cambridge dropped $15,000 per night at St. Mary's Hospital, where she stayed in the private Lindo Wing in a suite of two rooms. It is the same luxury hospital suite where <a title="Princess Diana Net Worth" href=#>Princess Diana</a> gave birth to <a title="Prince William Net Worth" href=#>Prince William</a>. That's the price she paid for the stay alone, not including delivery and consultant's fees. She was attended by England's top doctors and had a dedicated kitchen staff at her disposal. Her decision to give birth in a private hospital divided Britain, as 37% believe that she should have given birth through the National Health Service, feeling that this would have sent a strong message to the public, strengthening their trust. However, child delivery fees at St. Mary's Hospital are still much lower than in the U.S., and we are talking about a royal baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-new-jersey-hospitals-between-18-000-and-27-000><b>2. New Jersey Hospitals: Between $18,000 And $27,000</b></h2><p>Baby deliveries in American hospitals are the costliest in the world. Most hospitals charge a flat fee for delivery, regardless of the medical condition of the mother and any previous tests. They are billed per each item, meaning that expecting parents are charged per each individual service. The Garden State is the most expensive place in America to give birth. While the average expecting parents in the U.S. pay between $9,617 and $15,799, depending on the type of birth, pregnant women in New Jersey can expect to drop double that amount. That means $18,372 for a natural birth and $26,743 for a C-section. That's all without the expectation of any delivery problems. Add some medical issues to that, and the price might double, and that's just the average cost. Prices may vary by up to $30,000 between hospitals, making private medical centers in other states cheaper than public hospitals in New Jersey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-matilda-hospital-in-hong-kong-20-000-down-payment-for-a-room><b>1. Matilda Hospital in Hong Kong: $20,000 Down Payment For A Room</b></h2><p>Private hospitals in Hong Kong charge between $3,200 and $12,900 per day, and that's just for the room. Yes, it is more expensive than the typical hotel room in Hong Kong, but it is also much better. It is the ultimate pampering experience. Private hospitals in Hong Kong are luxurious to say the least. They feature so many amenities that you'll feel as if checking into a fancy hotel. They offer single rooms with balconies overlooking the ocean, refrigerators filled with juices and bottled water, cable TV, and WiFi. The doctor in charge of the delivery is also your personal gynecologist/obstetrician, and will be the one booking your stay and making all the necessary arrangements. It is advisable to ask your doctor to make reservations as early as possible, as most Hong Kong private hospitals are fully booked 7 months in advance. At the Matilda Hospital in Hong Kong, you need to deposit $20,000 in down payment just to book a room. However, not just any room, a room with a view, with its private balcony overlooking the South China Sea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGafqKugnsGiuNJmq6hll57DpnnBoqmtoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./timthetatman-twitch-star-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-wife-net-worth-career-early-life-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TimTheTatman (Twitch Star) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Career, Early Life, Fact</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tammy-knickerbocker-husband-kids-is-the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-star-related-to-shane-keough.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tammy Knickerbocker Husband &amp;amp; Kids: Is The Real Housewives Of Orange County Star Related To Shane Ke</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
