She was born on December 10 2014, in the United States of America. Lieberher’s zodiac sign is Sagittarius, and she has an American nationality. She is currently 9 years old. Lieberher’s hair colour is light brown. Jovi Lieberher’s parent’s name is Wes Lieberher and Angela Martell. Her siblings are Jaeden Lieberher, Sydney Quinn Lieberher and Hayes Lieberher. Jovi Lieberher is the minor child and the most pampered child in her family. Jovi Lieberher’s father works as an Executive Chef of the J Fall Group in Los Angeles. Jovi was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, with three siblings.</p><p>Jovi and her family are famous for her brother, Jaeden, a renowned actor. There is not much information about Jovi’s educational status, but she might have completed Kindergarten and probably would be planning to attend school at her age. Jovi Lieberher is too young to have love affairs or work in any field. She might be studying currently, so she has no earnings or net worth. But we feel that the way her brother Jaeden has been doing things likewise, she will do something great one day. Jovi is an adorable and beautiful kid. She is loved by all her family members and her brother’s fans. Jovi is a sweet and happy kid and has been very cheerful.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td><span>Celebrity Name</span></td><td>Jovi Lieberher</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><span>Popular For</span></td><td>Jaeden Lieberher’s Daughter</td></tr><tr><td><span>Profession</span></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span>Estimated Net Worth</span></td><td>$<span>2 Million</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><b>Birthday and Zodiac</b></p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><span>Age</span> (As of 2023)</td><td><span>9 years old</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Birth Date</span></td><td>December 10 2014</td></tr><tr><td><span>Birth Sign</span></td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td><span>Birth Place</span></td><td>USA</td></tr><tr><td><span>Nationality</span></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><span>Ethnicity</span></td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><b>Education</b></p><figure class=wp-block-table></figure><p><b>Physical Stats</b></p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><span>Height</span></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span>Weight</span></td><td><span>N/A</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Body Measurement</span></td><td><span>NA</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Body Type</span></td><td><span>Fit</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Hair Color</span></td><td><span>Black</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Eye Color</span></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><b>Family and relatives</b></p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td><span>Father&nbsp;</span></td><td>Wes Lieberher</td></tr><tr><td><span>Mother</span></td><td>Angela Martell</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><span>Siblings</span></td><td><span class=GzssTd>Jaeden Martell</span>, Sydney Quinn Lieberher Hayes Lieberher</td></tr><tr><td><span>Social Media</span></td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Biography_TimeLine><strong>Biography TimeLine</strong></span></h3><p>Jovi Lieberher is the daughter of actor Jaeden Martell, best known for his roles in films such as “It” and “Knives Out.” Despite being born into a family of actors, Jovi has primarily been kept out of the public eye and raised by her mother away from Hollywood.</p><ul><li><strong>2013:</strong> Jovi Lieberher was born to Jaeden Martell and his then-girlfriend Esther Lieberher.</li><li><strong>2015:</strong> Jaeden Martell gains fame for his role in the movie “St. Vincent.”</li><li><strong>2017:</strong> Martell stars in the horror movie “It,” which becomes a huge box office success.</li><li><strong>2019:</strong> Martell appears in the mystery-comedy film “Knives Out,” which receives critical acclaim.</li><li><strong>2020: </strong>Jovi’s mother posts a rare photo of her on Instagram, where she is seen smiling with her dad.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Family><strong>Family</strong></span></h3><p>Jovi Lieberher’s <b>father</b> is Wes Lieberher, and her mother is <strong>Angela Martell</strong>.
