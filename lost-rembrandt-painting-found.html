Dutch artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, best known as simply Rembrandt, is believed to have painted the piece between the years 1632-33.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty Rebranding After Selling to Coty Inc. For $200M</a></span></p><p>However, Rembrandt scholars have long believed the original painting was lost and only a handful of copies remained across Europe – until now. It was thought one of the copies was hanging in a country home located in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rome, Italy</a>. When the artwork fell off the wall and needed repair in 2016, it was sent to art restorer Antonella Di Francesco.</p><p>Upon seeing the piece, Di Francesco started to suspect it may be an original. She began cleaning the varnish that had accumulated in the hundreds of years since the painting’s creation. Upon finishing, she determined it is, in fact, a genuine Rembrandt piece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to the media, Di Francesco called the moment one of the highlights of her career. “[It was] one of the most beautiful things that can happen during a lifetime,” she said of the discovery.</p><p>The French Academy of the Villa Medici, located in Rome, also confirmed the painting is the original copy during a recent symposium, which featured a variety of academic scholars and art experts.</p><p>The event was held in partnership with the Heritage Foundation Italy (FPI), an NGO whose goal is to promote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Italian culture</a> and history. Their current project is “Discovering Masterpiece,” which aims to spread awareness of Italian art. In a press release, FPI’s President Guido Talarico described what an honor it was to kick off the project with the reveal of the original Rembrandt. He referred to it as a “source of great pride” for the organization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a> reports that the family who possessed the Rembrandt painting before the discovery have no plans to sell it, despite the piece being valued anywhere between $83.5 million to $240 million. They have, however, confirmed they are willing to loan the work to museums and galleries so it can be displayed to the public. The piece is currently being stored by art dealers.</p><p>Rembrandt is one of the most celebrated artists of the Dutch Golden Age. The 17th century artist is known for depicting a wide range of subject matter and using a variety of styles, including self-portraits, biblical settings, and landscapes. He lived from 1606 to 1669.</p><p>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown Facing Pricey Lawsuit After His Dog Allegedly Attacks Housekeeper</a></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8uoqq1lopq6o77Ap5utZaCWtq%2FAyKeeZp6fqrulew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./max-holloway-age-wiki-biography-body-measurement-parents-family-salary-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Max Holloway Age, Wiki, Biography, Body Measurement, Parents, Family, Salary, Net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-costner-was-homeless-after-first-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Costner Was Homeless After His First Divorce, Refused To Settle After His Second</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
