We'll take a look back at how tough things got for Perry and how seasons three to six of Friends ended up as a total blur for the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-s-co-stars-on-friends-knew-he-was-struggling-behind-the-scenes>Matthew Perry's Co-Stars On Friends Knew He Was Struggling Behind The Scenes</h2><p>Although he was among the funniest men in sitcom television during the '90s, things weren't exactly the same for Matthew Perry off-camera. He was enjoying major success and everything he ever dreamed of, however, things were spiraling in his life away from the camera.</p><p>Perry tuned to both alcohol and later Vicodin following a ski-accident in 1997.</p><p>Those around Perry knew he wasn't doing well, but according to the likes of Matt LeBlanc, Perry was not receptive to getting help.</p><p>“I tried to talk to him,” Friends costar LeBlanc, who played Joey Tribbiani, told People. “There wasn’t a response. It’s such a personal struggle; they need to bottom out on their own.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span></p><p>Lisa Kudrow would also agree, <a href=#>it was not easy to see a co-star in such rough shape</a>. “Hard doesn't even begin to describe it. When Matthew was sick, it was not fun. We were just hopelessly standing on the sidelines. We were hurting a lot. Matthew is one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life. He's charming and hilarious. Most of our hard laughs came from Matthew.''</p><p>More importantly, Perry himself knew that if a change wasn't going to be made, his life might've been at risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-was-facing-a-huge-addiction-battle-between-season-3-and-6-on-friends>Matthew Perry Was Facing A Huge Addiction Battle Between Season 3 And 6 On Friends</h2><p>One thing Matthew Perry did not do, was bringing his problems on the set of Friends. This means there was no drinking or anything of the sorts, “I had this odd rule that I would never drink on a set,” Perry told the New York Times.</p><p>“I went to work in extreme cases of hangovers. It's so horrible to feel that way and have to work and be funny on top of that.”</p><p>Perry was open about his struggles, claiming that seasons 3 to 6 were complete blurs. “I âdon't remember three years of it. I was a little out of it at the time — somewhere between seasons three and six.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Completely Lost It When Matt LeBlanc Messed Up His Line On 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all the help he was getting, Perry knew the decision to get cleaned up ultimately needed to be his own, and not a nudge from anyone else. “I wasn’t ready to hear it,” he admitted. “You can’t tell anyone to get sober. It has to come from you.”</p><p>And finally, that's exactly what happened.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-finally-decided-on-a-rehab-stint-during-the-later-years-on-friends>Matthew Perry Finally Decided On A Rehab Stint During The Later Years On Friends</h2><p>Finally, Perry decided to head back to LA and get sober alongside his parents. The major turning point, the fear of death.</p><p>“I didn't get sober because I felt like it,” he told the New York Times. “I got sober because I was worried I was going to die the next day.”</p><p>“It was scary. I didn’t want to die,” he said. “But I’m grateful for how bad it got. It only made me more adamant about trying to get better.”</p><p>Perry admitted the journey was not an easy one, especially given his status in the spotlight at the time. The actor was also aware that it was not a problem that be solved in a matter of days either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I'm a pretty private person, but I was on a TV show that 30 million people were watching, so people knew. It was so public what was happening to me,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “You can't have a drug problem for 30 years and expect to solve it in 28 days.”</p><p>Thankfully, the actor is in a much better place these days.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Has A Complicated Love Life Fans Don't Know About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXajBs8HGoKOeZZ%2Bjeqe%2ByJ6lnatdl7K1w8SepWarlZbAsLqMrZ%2BrnZVirq%2BwjKygsWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garrick-merrifield-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-80121-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Garrick Merrifield Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./formerly-dramatic-actors-who-went-on-to-star-in-sitcoms.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Formerly Dramatic Actors Who Went On To Star In Sitcoms</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
