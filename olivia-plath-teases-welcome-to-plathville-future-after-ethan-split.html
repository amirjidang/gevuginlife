(TLC has yet to officially renew the show for a sixth season).</p><p>“Will you still be on the show? I won’t watch anymore if you aren’t,” one fan asked the reality star, to which she simply replied, “Yes.”</p><p>Olivia’s relationship with Ethan has been a focal point of&nbsp;<i>Welcome to Plathville&nbsp;</i>since the show premiered in 2019. The twosome tied the knot in October 2018, despite often being at odds with Ethan’s mom, <strong>Kim Plath</strong>, over wedding plans. After their nuptials, Olivia and Ethan struggled through multiple rough paths in their relationship. They ultimately<a href=#> announced their break up</a> in October.</p><p>“Ethan and I have decided to go our separate ways,” Olivia wrote via Instagram at the time. “I have ambivalent memories of us being 18 years old, innocently dreaming of forever – but the partner you choose is a reflection of the world you want to live in, and at 18 I didn’t know who I was or what kind of life I wanted to create for myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Olivia-Plath-Teases-Her-Welcome-to-Plathville-Future-After-Split-From-Estranged-Husband-Ethan-Platt-007.jpg><p>She noted that the pair did have “good moments” between them, which she wanted to continue to honor, adding, “We fell in love as children and are going our separate ways as adults. Wiser, older and braver. We will be OK.”</p><p>Ethan, for his part, addressed the split via his own Instagram, sharing that they both “gave it all” they had but their marriage “just didn’t work out.”</p><p>“It seemed we were constantly pulling each other<a href=#> in opposite directions in life</a> with different goals,” he explained. “I wish Olivia the best in the future ahead. I care for her deeply and always will.”</p><p>The split was later featured on the season 5 finale, which aired on Tuesday, December 5. The twosome had spent much <a href=#>of the season arguing</a> over their differing beliefs on things like politics, religion and <a href=#>how to raise</a> their hypothetical children.</p><p>“The faith and the world that I grew up in was a world built for men, that worked for men. And to tell me that I need to go back to a culture and a faith and a belief that told me that I was worth nothing without a husband, that in a relationship I just need to submit and say ‘yes’ and cook three meals a day and praise God and it would all be fine,” Olivia, who has been vocal about pushing back against the fundamentalist Christian traditions she was raised with, told her now-estranged husband in the episode. “I don’t think you understand the privilege you have to look at me and tell me<a href=#> I need to go back to that</a> because it served you.”</p><p>Ethan, however, argued that there are different “roles” that men and women should “play” in a household. “That’s natural. That’s inherent in us,” he claimed. “And the whole thing, cooking three meals a day, that is one of the only keys to a man’s heart. When’s the last time you cooked a meal?”</p><p>The conversation ended with the pair saying they were not the right “romantic partners” for one another before a final card stated that “Olivia and Ethan have mutually decided to file for divorce.” (Neither Ethan nor Olivia have filed for divorce as of December.)</p><p>During Thursday’s Instagram Q&A, Olivia revealed that she has made the move from Minnesota to the West Coast since calling it quits with Ethan.</p><p>“I moved to Los Angeles earlier this year for a fresh start while I figured out where I wanted to put down roots,” Olivia shared when asked where she plans to live next. “It’s been a lovely 6 months in L.A. learning to surf, making new friends, enjoying the scenery and weather, etc. I needed some time to take deep breaths and figure out some internal things. Los Angeles is not a permanent decision, but I’ve always wanted to live in California and couldn’t before, so I decided to do that now while I can.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Olivia added that she has no plans <a href=#>to change her last name</a> now despite her separation from Ethan — “Sometimes I joke that I’ve f–king earned” that name, she said — but she is open to finding love again.</p><p>When a fan asked if she wanted to date again, she replied, “Yes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKaloaaerm68y5qroWWkmq60sdJmrp6kk6S6pnnTqGSppJGptbe1y6WcZp6lqcKzsYyana2domKytbTAp2SsqJyewXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hilton-spent-fortune-43-birthday-included-private-jet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton Spent A Fortune On Her 43rd Birthday That Included A Private Jet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neezeelee-dress-pants-lounge-yoga-amazon-fashion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neezeelee Dress Pants Feel Just Like Lounge Pants</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
