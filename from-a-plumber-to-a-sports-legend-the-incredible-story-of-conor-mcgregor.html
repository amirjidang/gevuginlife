His life reads like a real rag to riches story, with an incredibly dramatic difference between his very simple, early days as a plumber and the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxurious lifestyle that he leads today</a>. He's described as being both fearless and ferocious, and his talent in the ring is undeniable to anyone watching his impeccable skills as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he knocks out opponent after opponent</a>. His parents once tried to discourage their young son from pursuing a fight-based career, but chances are, as he stands atop an astronomical $200 million net worth, they're happy he opted to follow his dreams.</p><h2 id=very-humble-beginnings>Very Humble Beginnings</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The wealthy man that fans see before them today is not at all indicative or reflective of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the very simple life that Conor McGregor once knew</a>. He was born in Crumlin, Ireland, to parents Margaret and Tony McGregor, who provided a very simple, humble life for their young child. Earning enough money was a struggle for his family. As a young man, Conor faced many challenges in school and completely lost interest. Rather than putting his focus on his education, McGregor chose a career in the trades, working as a plumber to help his family pay the bills. He was a hard-working young man that regularly spent 12-15 hours on the job site, doing the job he didn't at all enjoy. He slaved through plumbing jobs and sour treatment on the job site, where he always felt inferior and unhappy.</p><p>After the grueling, long shift at work, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McGregor would head to the gym to train</a> as a fighter. It was there that his frustrations were let loose, and his skills were put to use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That was where Conor McGregor would thrive the most and truly where he wanted to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conor McGregor Wants UFC To Create Championship For How Rich He Is</a></span></p><h2 id=combat-is-my-life>'Combat Is My Life'</h2><p>McGregor was barely carving out a hand-to-mouth life for himself working as a plumber, and little did he know that when he turned 25 years old, his entire life would change.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking of his early days </a>slaving as a tradesman, McGregor says, "It's mind-blowing. But I never forget the struggles<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">. I never forget where I came from.</a> I never ever forget the hard times." He resented the position he found himself in as a young man and absolutely hated working away as a plumber for very little money and absolutely no sort of fulfilling reward. He says, "When things were really bad I didn't have a pot to p*ss in. Really, nothing. I'm not a stupid guy and it was hard standing in a dole queue."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He eventually decided this was too much for him. "I hated every minute of it, you were talking 14 or 15-hour days. I was getting ordered around, getting people their lunch, all this crap. I just thought, 'This life isn't for me, I'm going to pack it in. I'm going to chase my dreams."</p><p>He then went on to declare to his parents, "Combat Is My Life," and that statement quickly came into fruition. At the age of 25, in 2013, McGregor was discovered by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and was immediately signed.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His life was forever changed.</a></p><h2 id=fighting-his-way-to-a-multi-million-dollar-fortune>Fighting His Way To A Multi-Million Dollar Fortune</h2><p>McGregor's explosive punches and cocky media persona have blended to create the perfect melting pot of intrigue meets skill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notable moments</a> go, the New York Post reports that,&nbsp;"McGregor defeated his opponent Marcus Brimage in just 67 seconds in his first fight in the biggest mixed martial arts promotion in the world, earning him an extra $60,000 for a knockout of the night bonus to go with the $8,000 he was paid to appear and an added $8,000 he earned by winning."</p><p>This singular moment earned McGregor more money in mere minutes than he had ever made in his entire life.</p><p>It was just the beginning.</p><p>Just over a year later, McGregor made a pay-per-view appearance and earned himself an astounding $180,000 as he quickly demolished Dustin Poirier in their first very first match-up.</p><p>His career began with the defeat of Chad Mendes by way of total knockout in July of 2015 and led to the 13-second defeat of Jose Aldo a mere five months later. This instantly launched McGregor into the millionaire's club.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McGregor's fight against Nate Diaz earned him the title of being UFC's highest-paid fighter, and he was recognized on Forbes's top 100 list for the very first time. Aiding the launch of this extreme level of success was the massive $50 million payouts he received from his October 2018 fight against Khabib. His fight money is big money.</p><p>Conor McGregor's career has been filled with highs and lows, all of them generating the publicity that he required to fuel his ego and line his bank account with an enormous amount of wealth.</p><p>Today, McGregor's life is a far cry from the one he once knew in Ireland. He is surrounded by private jets, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury cars</a><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">, big-name labels</a> and owns multi-million dollar mansions. Each fight is a multi-million purse, and he's very much in charge of his own destiny. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He now owns a luxury yacht </a>and has commented on<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his current lifestyle</a> by saying, "I pinch myself because I am surrounded by luxury. But make no mistake – it's luxury built on sacrifice."</p><h2 id=earnings-outside-of-the-ring>Earnings Outside Of The Ring</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proving to be a double threat, Conor McGregor has also diversified his earnings to include far more than fight money. He has carved his own path as a business entrepreneur with lucrative investments in alcohol brands bearing his influence.</p><p>Proper No. 12 Whiskey is his first non-combat business venture and is Conor McGregor has made a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">small fortune on alcohol sales </a>alone. He then went on to sell the whiskey brand for an astronomical amount of money, positioning him as one of the highest earners in this arena.</p><p>There's no telling what Conor McGregor will do next, but one thing is for certain, he's sure to turn a pretty profit off of it.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Mr. Bean's Garage: 10 Cars In Rowan Atkinson's $15 Million Car Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> First Post,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzs7vMZphmqJyquqOx0WarqGWRYsCxu9GtqmaklZyyr7CMrZ%2BeZZmjsLOxw6KZpZ1dqMGwvthmpp9lk6S7sL6MppqgqpWcvLN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sex-educations-mimi-keene-net-worth-ethnicity-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About 'Sex Education's Mimi Keene And Her Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tamara-vaifanua-fox13-bio-age-husband-children-salary-height-hair-good-day-utah-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tamara Vaifanua FOX13, Bio, Age, Husband, Children, Salary, Height, Hair, Good Day Utah and Net Wort</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
