(Saget previously appeared in a <a href=#>November 2017 episode</a> of the popular YouTube series.)</p><p>Following the dark joke, Stamos clarified Saget “would do that joke if he was alive to me,” adding, “He wouldn’t have waited a year and a half either. He would say the worst things.”</p><p>Stamos starred alongside Saget on the beloved sitcom <a href=#>Full House</a> from 1987 to 1995. Saget <a href=#>passed away at the age of 65</a> in January 2022 following a stand-up comedy performance in Florida. His <a href=#>cause of death</a> was later revealed to be blunt head trauma caused by <a href=#>an accidental fall</a> in his Ritz Carlton hotel room.</p><p>At the time of his former costar’s death, Stamos tweeted that he was <a href=#>“broken” and “gutted” by the news</a>. “I am in complete and utter shock,” he wrote. “I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.”</p><p>Later that year, Stamos exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Saget never knew “how loved he was,” adding, “I wish that you could sort of bring him back and sit him down and … you know, read everything, I’m sure he’s seeing everything. ‘Cause I can hear him complain sometimes if I’m very quiet from heaven. He’s like, ‘What, why did you say that, John?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/John-Stamos-Jokes-Full-House-Costar-Bob-Sagets-Hot-Ones-Episode-Is-What-Killed-Him1.jpg><p>Stamos continued to keep Saget’s memory alive during his Hot Ones appearance by recalling an embarrassing story about going to a strip club with Saget and <a href=#><strong>Dave Coulier</strong></a> during the early days of Full House.</p><p>“Bob was always very, like, ‘I’m too famous.’ I said, ‘It’s alright. Put a hat on or something. And don’t worry, I know the guys there. I’ll take care of this,’” Stamos shared. Though the trio attempted to remain low-key in the club, it didn’t take long for their presence to be known.</p><p>According to Stamos, an announcer stated, “‘And coming here live, look at this, the boys from Full House. Uncle Jesse, Joey and Danny! Give them a big round [of applause].’”</p><p>In addition to the funny memory, Stamos revealed that he wasn’t always a fan of being on Full House. After the show was pitched to him as <a href=#>Bosom Buddies</a> with “a couple of kids in the background,” he began to question why the casting process for the kid roles — played by <a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jodie Sweetin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mary-Kate</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Olsen</strong></a> — was taking so long. He later realized why during one of the show’s first table reads.</p><p>“Jodie Sweetin, who plays Stephanie, reads her lines and people are dying laughing, I mean, screaming. I was like, ‘What’s happening here?’” he told Hot Ones host <a href=#><strong>Sean Evans</strong></a>. “They couldn’t even hear my lines, they were laughing so hard at her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/John-Stamos-Jokes-Full-House-Costar-Bob-Sagets-Hot-Ones-Episode-Is-What-Killed-Him2.jpg><p>After the table read, he called his agent and asked them to “get me the f—k off this show” — though his opinion of the series changed over time.</p><p>“I fought it a long time and then I finally said, ‘What am I doing? <a href=#>It’s a beautiful show</a> we built with sweetness and kindness,’” Stamos noted. “There was no central character on the show, is what I realized. The central character was love. We were the best representation of a loving family and not a normal family. And it was the new normal, was now an unconventional family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ5iwLWtzKiqZqKfoLK0ecGomWarkZyytb%2BMoaatZZ%2BjsrR5xKmgrKeUmnqstculnJ1lmJ66cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-caz-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-151324-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Caz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-graham-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Graham Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
