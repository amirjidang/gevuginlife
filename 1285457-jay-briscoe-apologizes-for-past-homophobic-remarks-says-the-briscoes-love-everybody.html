After ROH went on hiatus and reportedly opted not to renew the contracts of their talent roster, many fans assumed Mark and Jay would sign with <a href=#>AEW</a>. The Briscoes have been feuding with FTR for the past several months through heated social media exchanges, and the rivalry reached a new level when Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler brawled with Mark and Jay at ROH Final Battle.</p><p>Three months later, The Briscoes have yet to appear on AEW programming. On March 11, <a href=#>Fightful Select</a> reported that AEW doesn’t plan to sign the duo, as WarnerMedia sources made it clear that an influential figure <a href=#>didn’t want them to work there</a> as a result of Jay’s homophobic tweet in 2013.</p><p>During an appearance on the<a href=#> Battleground Podcast</a>, Jay took the opportunity to apologize for his past tweet and explain that The Briscoes “love everybody.” He made it clear that he regretted his remark by calling it the “most dumbest, immature, obnoxious s— I’ve ever done.”</p><p>“I want to say thank you to the people that really know, because we get labeled, man, as homophobes,” said Jay. “I put out a stupid tweet nine years ago. Most dumbest, immature, obnoxious s— I’ve ever done. And I feel like, I don’t want anybody from any walk of life to feel like they can’t cheer for The Briscoes. Because I promise we love everybody. We love everybody, and we just want to go out there and be pro wrestlers, man, give the best match that we can. Again, I said some dumb s— a long time ago. I apologized for it, and I’ll apologize for it again. It was stupid. But I feel like now there’s people who kinda look at us like, ‘We can’t cheer for them because they hate a certain group of people.’ We don’t hate nobody, man. We love everybody, I promise y’all. We’re just some old god-fearing country boys. I thought I was taking a stand for the lord back in the day.”</p><p>Mark chimed in by explaining that Jay realized he was in the wrong.</p><p>“You realized from that immaturity that that’s not what you were doing,” said Mark. “Because before anything, God, the lord, he’s about love above anything, like that trumps everything else. So what you thought you were doing, taking a stand for the lord, it was counterproductive to the kingdom of God, not only to being a human being and relating with other humans who, we all live with and gotta relate to and love and coexist with.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>New Episode!
