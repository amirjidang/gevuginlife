However, as anyone familiar with <a href=#>the history of Foxx’s acting career</a> should already know, Jamie took the television landscape by storm before all of that. First introduced to millions of people when he starred in the legendary sketch comedy show In Living Color, the beloved actor then went on to headline The Jamie Foxx Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Foxx Talks Playing Multiple Roles On Netflix's 'Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!'</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that Jamie Foxx was a movie star who was making a return to the medium that made him a star, when it was announced that he was starring in a sitcom people were very excited. In fact, there was so much interest in Foxx’s sitcom Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! before it premiered that there were headlines about the <a href=#>other actors who were joining the show’s cast</a>. Sadly, however, Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! wound up being canceled after airing only a single season on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. After news broke that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! had been canceled, that left Foxx’s fans with only one question, why?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-dad-stop-embarrassing-me-based-on>What is Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! Based On?</h2><p>Over the last several years, Netflix has proven time and time again that it is a great home for TV shows that get everyone talking. For example, there is no doubt that Netflix shows like Stranger Things, Queer Eye, Squid Games, Bridgerton, Ozark, All of Us Are Dead, and You all caught the world’s attention. With that in mind, it makes sense that when it was announced that Jamie Foxx was set to star in a sitcom for the streaming giant, everyone thought it was a great fit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>IMDb Claims This Is The Best Netflix Original Series</a></span></p><p>Of course, even though Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! starred a major star and was set to stream on Netflix, that didn’t inherently mean that people would watch it. Thankfully for everyone involved in the show’s production, however, it seemed like the show was set up perfectly for success since Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! had a highly relatable plot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! went into production, Jamie Foxx’s daughter Corrine was in her late-20s and she had a very different relationship with her father. When Corrine was a teenager, however, her father Jamie often was the source of great embarrassment for her. Since most teens think their parents are too much and virtually every parent will eventually learn how it feels to embarrass their kids, a show about that dynamic is easy to relate to. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that Jamie Foxx and his daughter Corrine decided to co-produce Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, a show that recreated their relationship when she was a teen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-dad-stop-embarrassing-me-was-canceled>Why Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! Was Canceled</h2><p>If there is one thing that is abundantly clear about Hollywood, it is this, the powers that be in the entertainment business bend over backward to give stars whatever they want. After all, it is well known that many of the biggest stars have a small fleet of assistants whose entire job is to fetch them whatever they want. Furthermore, it is no secret that some actors are notoriously demanding behind the scenes. With all of that in mind, it seems shocking that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! was canceled after one season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Actors Who Were Notoriously Demanding On Set</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, there is a very good reason why Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! was canceled despite Jamie Foxx’s involvement, he reportedly wanted the show to end. In June of 2021, Deadline was the first outlet to report that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! was ending after a single season. According to their report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Foxx “was reportedly involved in the decision to end the series”</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-jamie-foxx-wanted-dad-stop-embarrassing-me-to-end>Why Jamie Foxx Wanted Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! To End.</h2><p>In the lead-up to the release of Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!’s first and only season, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the show’s cast made the rounds promoting the project. However, when a show ends, its stars typically just move on to their next project instead of talking to the press again about the series’s failure. With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that Foxx isn’t going around talking about Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! ending. Despite that, the reasons why Foxx reportedly wanted the show to end seem very clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the popular consensus among fans and critics alike, Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! wasn’t a great show by any means. For proof of that, all you have to do is look at the fact that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! has a 25% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the audience score is only 48%. Similarly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! has an IMDb score of just 4.2/10</a>. If all of those numbers aren’t proof enough that Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! was a bad show, search Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! review on YouTube.
