Actress <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> will be making her directorial debut, and has also been credited as a co-writer. However, following the trailer release, congratulating Lively is not what most fans are thinking of doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the teaser, Swift confirmed that the video will be for her song "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version)</a>." Twitter has been celebrating the announcement of the video, and has since posted their excitement for its premiere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although "I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version)" will be what the video is for, Twitter has continued to play song guessing games. Following her social media post, most users have guessed the music video to be for "Blank Space," "betty," and "Message In A Bottle." Interestingly enough, "Blank Space" and "betty" are songs that were not included in Red or Red (Taylor's Version).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Camila Cabello Celebrated Red Day With A Scarf Gifted By Taylor Swift</a></span></p><h2 id=quot-all-too-well-quot-became-a-hit-sensation>"All Too Well" Became A Hit Sensation</h2><p>The hype for her next music video comes shortly after Swift released All Too Well: The Short Film, starring <a href=#>Dylan O'Brien</a> and <a href=#>Sadie Sink</a>. Supporting the longer version of her song "All Too Well," the video received positive reviews. Brittany Spanos of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> called it a "dramatic and moving film that digs deep into heartache and scarf lore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of this publication, the video has received over 22 million views, and has been the number one trending video on YouTube for the first 48 hours after its release. O'Brien has also added (Taylor's Version) to his Twitter account after the video premiere, and the video recently played during Swift's debut performance of the song on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Blake Lively Shares Her Real Opinions About Y2K Fashion</a></span></p><h2 id=not-entirely-forgotten-by-the-fans>Not Entirely Forgotten By The Fans</h2><p>Although Swifties have not congratulated the A Simple Favor actress for her participation in the video, her fans have begun to show love for her on Twitter.
