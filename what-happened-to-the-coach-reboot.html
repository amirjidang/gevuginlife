Instead of airing some episodes to test out audience reactions, this show never even saw the light of day.</p><p>Let's take a look and see what happened with this failed revival.</p><h2 id=39-coach-39-was-a-huge-show>'Coach' Was A Huge Show</h2><p>From 1989 to 1997, Coach was an incredibly successful television series that was focused on a college football coach at Minnesota State University. This series was released at the right time, and eventually, it turned into a popular show that people kept on the small screen for years on end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring talented performers like Craig T. Nelson, Shelley Fabares, and Jerry Van Dyke, Coach was a hilarious show that has become pretty underrated in the years since its end. People talk a lot about other shows from the 1990s, but Coach hardly gets brought up. This is pretty surprising, considering that the series was able to last for 200 episodes.</p><p>In spite of the fact that the show isn't mentioned alongside other hits from the 1990s like Seinfeld or Friends, there is simply no denying its place in television history. Hitting 100 episodes is already difficult enough to do, but being able to hit the 200-episode mark is a truly exceptional feat that deserves some acknowledgment.</p><p>After being off the air for years, the idea of a revival series was soon floated around. This is pretty common practice in Hollywood, as cashing in on established names is often times a lucrative route to go. Lo and behold, Coach was going to make a comeback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things We Currently Know About The 'iCarly' Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=39-coach-39-was-going-to-be-revived>'Coach' Was Going To Be Revived</h2><p>In 2015, it was reported that the series was going to be making a comeback for modern audiences. This was quite the surprise, but some fans who grew up watching the show were excited to see the direction that the series would be heading.</p><p>"The new show followed Hayden’s adopted son, Tim (seen at the end of the original series as a toddler), who had been tasked with launching a football program at the fictional Penn Institute (think M.I.T.). He’s talked into hiring his father as his head assistant, giving Hayden­–still living in a Minnesota cabin, and back to his old, gruff habits­­–something to do a year after his wife Christine (played by Shelley Fabares in the original series) died," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> writes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you could imagine, many people were stunned that this show was coming back, and not in a good way. No one was pounding the table for a Coach revival, but the network still rolled the dice on the show.</p><p>After the announcement, the series was moving along and gearing up to hit the small screen. Of course, there is no way of telling how things will play out in the long run, but clearly, the network was comfortable enough to give it a chance.</p><p>Sadly, the return of Coach was shot down before audiences even had a chance to catch up with their old friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What We Know About The 'Sex And The City' Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=39-coach-39-was-axed-immediately>'Coach' Was Axed Immediately</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, "The “Coach” revival series is, well, not being revived at NBC. Variety has confirmed the comedy is not moving forward at the network with insiders citing creative issues for the network’s change in heart.The project, which landed a straight-to-series 13-episode order this past March, was set to pick up 18 years after the sitcom went off the air. Original star Craig T. Nelson was cast to reprise his role as Coach Hayden Fox in the sequel series, which was slated for a midseason debut.Though the mid-production cancellation seems sudden, the series was only garnering mixed reviews internally."</p><p>Just like that, this revival was down for the count. Again, many people were confused about the project coming together in the first place, and the network was unimpressed with what the show was bringing to them. This is what ultimately sank the show before it even made it to TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been successful revivals since Coach's ill-fated attempt, which just shows how fickle revival projects are.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Excited For Cartoon Network's 'Total Drama Island' Revival</a></span></p><p>Coach might have been a good series during the 1990s, but modern audiences and network executives weren't interested this time around.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why David Yost's Idea For A 'Power Rangers' Revival Merits Serious Consideration</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmScp5GYtW6%2BxJumqKxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-steve-patterson-going-is-he-leaving-tcl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Steve Patterson Going?
