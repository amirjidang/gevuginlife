Similar to Kyle's house in Bel-Air, the home has a gorgeous kitchen that is perfect for anyone who loves cooking or even just hanging out in there, and the foyer has a black and white checked pattern.</p><p>Real estate and decor seems to be a passion for Richards, who spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating her house in Encino</a> with Bravotv.com. She said, “I’m actually changing kind of everything. When I first bought the house, I was like, ‘Oh, it looks great like it is.’ Then, once we were burglarized, I thought I was going to sell my house. I was like, ‘I’m over this. I don’t want to live here anymore.' That’s why I kept my house in Bel-Air, the one that Sutton [Stracke] was leasing from me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-kyle-richards-39-s-rhobh-salary>What Is Kyle Richards's RHOBH Salary?</h2><p>While it's possible to think that Kyle Richards has so much money because of her 12 seasons and counting of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, she might not be making quite as much as fans assume that she is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Real-Housewives-Beverly-Hills-Featured-Image.jpg><p>According to Reality Blurb, someone posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RHOBH cast salaries</a> on Instagram, but these were never confirmed by Bravo or any of the cast members.

My plate is full right now."</p><p>While Kyle of course makes her own money and her net worth is really high, there's no denying that Mauricio has gotten very rich from real estate. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he is worth $100 million and his official bio on The Agency's website shares that he is the one agent in the United States who has sold a lot of houses that go for above $20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXaDGrbGMq6CcoJGnsbR5xp6rZqiRnrFuss6rZKudkaF6qbvUrJywoaaawG67xWaZnq6Vp7m6eceio6WrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2nsqK4jJ6qrZmkmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aew-matches-5-6-stars-dave-meltzer-rating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Every AEW Match Rated 5 Stars Or More By Dave Meltzer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-jason-aldean-have-a-brother-fans-wondering-about-nephew-logan-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Jason Aldean Have A Brother?
