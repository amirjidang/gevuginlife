On-screen, Haley dated a slew of men, many of whom became recurring characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few of those characters actually turned out to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyland’s real-life boyfriends</a>. Matt Prokop, with whom Hyland had a five-year relationship, was the first of Hyland’s significant others to appear on the hit ABC sitcom. Dominic Sherwood, who dated Hyland for three years, appeared much later in the series. Find out how these actors landed roles on Modern Family and why their relationships with Hyland ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family: 10 Things The Cast Members Have Said About Working On The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-matt-prokop-and-when-did-he-appear-on-modern-family>Who Is Matt Prokop And When Did He Appear On ‘Modern Family’?</h2><p>Matt Prokop was a teen heartthrob when he skyrocketed to fame via Disney. He appeared on Hannah Montana in 2006 as Troy McCann in one episode, and in High School Musical 3: Senior Year in 2008 as Jimmie Zara. His role in High School Musical was significant enough to earn him even more attention in Hollywood, including the attention of Sarah Hyland. In fact, Hyland and Prokop met while auditioning for the famous Disney franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, the couple had the opportunity to star alongside each other in a Disney channel original movie, Geek Charming. They also began living together and even got a Maltipoo named Barkley Bixby.</p><p>In 2012, Prokop appeared on Modern Family in Season 3, Episode 22. He once again played Hyland’s love interest, starring as Ethan. In the episode, Claire (Julie Bowen) arranged for Haley (Sarah Hyland) to meet him, so that she would potentially stop pining over her on-again-off-again boyfriend Dylan (Reid Ewing.) Though Haley went back to Dylan by the end of the episode, Ethan made quite the impression on Haley’s other family members, including her sister and uncles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which 'Modern Family' Cast Member Has The Biggest House?</a></span></p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-s-relationship-with-matt-prokop-was-abusive>Sarah Hyland’s Relationship with Matt Prokop was Abusive</h2><p>Content Warning: Domestic Abuse</p><p>After five years in the relationship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Hyland and Matt Prokop broke up in 2014</a>. However, the break up was not as smooth as it originally seemed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2014, Hyland got a three-year temporary restraining order against Prokop. Legal documents detailed the need for the restraining order, stating that Prokop "terrorized [Sarah] both verbally and physically during the last four years of their relationship." Hyland claimed that Prokop threatened her and her dog. During one fight, he reportedly choked her so hard that she “could not breathe or speak.”</p><p>Fearful for her life, Hyland asked Julie Bowen (her on-screen Modern Family mom) to be there for the breakup. This caused Prokop to allegedly threaten to set Hyland’s house on fire and tell her “she would never see her dog again.”</p><p>Fortunately, Hyland was granted a permanent restraining order a few months after receiving the temporary one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prokop has not appeared in any films or TV shows</a> since 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Hyland’s 10 Most Stunning & Wholesome Instagram Pics</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-dominic-sherwood-and-when-did-he-appear-on-modern-family>Who Is Dominic Sherwood, And When Did He Appear On ‘Modern Family’?</h2><p>Dominic Sherwood is an English actor and model who is best known for his roles in Vampire Academy, Shadowhunters, and Billionaire Ransom. He also received significant attention for appearing in Taylor Swift’s music video, Style, as her love interest.</p><p>Hyland and Sherwood first met while co-starring in Vampire Academy. They were very open about their relationship on Instagram. Hyland in particular gave Sherwood high praise in many an Instagram caption.</p><p>In 2016, Sherwood appeared in Episode 21, Season 7 of Modern Family as James. Instead of playing Haley’s love interest, he played the love interest of her sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Dunphy (Ariel Winter.)</a> Alex fell for him but didn’t realize he was a thief and wanted only her wallet!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout 2016 and much of 2017, Hyland and Sherwood’s relationship was as strong as ever. In an interview with ET, Sherwood <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained that it was hard to pick what he loved most about Hyland</a>.</p><p>“Sarah makes me want to be a better version of myself," Sherwood said. "That's what I love most about her. She inspires me to be the best version of me." The couple revealed many other lovey-dovey facts about their relationship, such as Sherwood buying Hyland a guitar so that she could learn to play.</p><p>Despite their seemingly strong relationship, the two called it quits in August 2017. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Sherwood said that “it was a tricky conversation.” According to ET, the pair decided to remain friends after the split.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-s-relationship-with-wells-adams>Sarah Hyland’s Relationship With Wells Adams</h2><p>Hyland is now in a healthy and loving relationship with Bachelor star Wells Adams.

Instead... we took pictures and drank wine. I love you to Pluto & back.”</p><p>So, when will Hyland and Adams actually get married?
