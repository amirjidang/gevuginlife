It’s like, do you take this work opportunity and this great chance that you have or do you be there for your family? It’s a tough decision for sure.”</p><p>Since the personal trainer did choose to compete on The Challenge: Spies, Lies and Allies, he had a far different experience than his costars <strong>Nelson</strong> [<strong>Thomas</strong>] and <strong>Fessy</strong> [<strong>Shafaat</strong>], “who get to just check in with themselves and then get to go and … enjoy themselves.”</p><p>Wharton explained, “I have a lot of people at home that depend on me. So when I go to The Challenge, I’m clocking into work. I’m away from my family. … It’s hard on a lot of people.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Ex on the Beach</a> alum is also the father of <a href=#>daughter Mila</a>, 15 months, with <strong>Taylor Selfridge</strong>. As for Floyd, she is engaged to <strong>Zach Davis</strong>, and the pair share<a href=#> son Ace</a>, 1 month.</p><p>Wharton and Davis, 30, both “understand their place in that situation,” Floyd exclusively told Us in January of coparenting.</p><p>“Zach acknowledges that we choose to do things as a family for Ryder,” the <a href=#>Are You the One? </a>alum told Us at the time. “Cory and Zach have their own relationship and have had their chats and everyone’s still alive. So I guess it’s good. … If there’s an issue, we talk about it and move on. So things from the past? Really not a problem.”</p><p>While raising Ryder together seemed “overwhelming” at first, Floyd noted that she and Wharton have<a href=#> “mastered” their dynamic</a> and don’t “hold grudges.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Challenge 37 premieres on MTV Wednesday, August 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Emily Longeretta</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp6Kueri0wKurqKZdmLWmxcSnpZ5llqG8urCMnaCsmZensqZ5wKxkoZ1dnLymv4yopWasmJp6pLTApaOeppeafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-richards-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dave Richards Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ciara-claps-back-after-trolls-slam-naked-vanity-fair-party-dress.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ciara Claps Back After Trolls Slam 'Naked' Vanity Fair Party Dress</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
