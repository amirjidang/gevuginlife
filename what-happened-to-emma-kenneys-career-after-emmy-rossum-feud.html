Most of her co-stars spoke positively about her involvement on the series, including William H. Macy. However, Emma Kenney saw things differently. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She described her time alongside Rossum as tense</a> at times, while revealing that the mood of the show changed behind the scenes was she departed.</p><p>"It was weird at first, but the set became a more positive place. I'm not going to lie," Kenney said. "I remember pre-her leaving, I'd go to set some days and I'd be very anxious having a scene with her because if she had a bad day, she made it a bad day for everybody."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Emmy Rossum Demanded An Equal Pay To William H.

"Maybe she was struggling with her own inner problems and taking it out on other people."</p><p>Ultimately, Rossum nor her reps decided to answer the criticisms made from her co-star. As far as Emmy was concerned, she was leaving the show given that her character had peaked, and it was time to move on, especially creatively for both herself, and Fiona on Shameless.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Close Were Shameless' Emmy Rossum And Jeremy Allen White?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-conners-was-emma-kenney-39-s-biggest-project-since-shameless-while-she-has-interest-in-directing-and-photography-work-behind-the-camera>The Conners Was Emma Kenney's Biggest Project Since Shameless, While She Has Interest In Directing And Photography Work Behind The Camera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whitney-cummings-michael-fishman-john-goodman-roseanne-barr-sarah-gilbert-sarah-chalke-emma-kenney-and-jayden-rey-at-the-roseanne-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When discussing what was next at the time, Kenney pointed to The Conners.

I haven’t in a long time since pre-Shameless! I was young. But my biggest passion is photography, and that’s something I am really enjoying lately.

"I want to say that was when I was like 17, 18, I think I started to really feel comfortable in my own skin and comfortable to do the best that I could do in front of the camera, and I wasn't holding back anymore with fear of being judged."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked what she would miss most from the show, Kenney didn't hesitate with her response. She told Glitter that it was hard to say goodbye to her fellow co-stars, and the interactions that would take place behind the camera.</p><p>"The daily interaction, our constant laughter, and ability to give and receive honest advice to and from each other. It’s a real family dynamic, as cliche as it sounds. I mean, after eleven consistent years in our most pivotal years of life, how could we not be?"</p><p>The show clearly had quite the impact on Kenney, both positively and negatively.
