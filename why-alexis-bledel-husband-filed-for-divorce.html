In June 2012, the two were spotted smooching on a flight from New York City to Los Angeles. A source then confirmed that they had been dating "for a few months" already. "They have been dating for a few months," said the insider. "Vincent is smart and charming.</p><p>He's nothing like his character!" Kartheiser later said that he didn't expect to develop feelings for Bledel. "We were completely professional. We never saw each other out," he told Vulture. "We never—it was nothing, it was just work." However, the couple's co-stars had always known that they liked each other early on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did know he liked her from a very early point," said <a href=#>Top Gun: Maverick star, Jon Hamm</a>. "I was a supporter of that union." Mad Men creator, Matthew Wiener also thought that the two were a good fit for each other. "Honestly, they're a really good match," he said. "They're both very down to earth, with a sense of responsibility and strong family ties. And they've been acting since before they can remember, which makes for a very special personality. It's not just that I thought they would look cute together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that it was Bledel's acting skills that won Kartheiser's heart. "Even with all of Alexis's amazing qualities, I think that if she had not been such a good actress, he would not have been interested," Wiener explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why 'Gilmore Girls' Almost Didn't Get Picked Up Each Season</a></span></p><h2 id=when-did-alexis-bledel-amp-vincent-kartheiser-get-married>When Did Alexis Bledel & Vincent Kartheiser Get Married?</h2><p>In March 2013, Bledel's rep confirmed that she and Kartheiser had just gotten engaged. The next month, the actress shared a few details about their wedding plans during the L.A. premiere of her TV film, Remember Sunday. "We're doing it together. We haven't started yet though," she told Us Weekly. She also revealed that her round-cut diamond ring was picked out by her then-fiancé himself.</p><p>In June 2014, the two tied the knot in a secret ceremony in Ojai, California. "It was a small and intimate family affair," said an insider. "They wanted something relaxed and beautiful. Ojai was the perfect place. His family flew out from the East Coast."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two months before their intimate wedding, Kartheiser explained the real reason they kept their relationship private. "It's something I realized about the most important things in my life," he said.</p><p>"If I share them with the world and I open that door to their fuming anger that they need to get out or their adoration that they want to flaunt, it lessens it. It cheapens it; it weakens it. And it's magical, love, and all of that is ... profoundly spiritual, and it just doesn't feel right."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Bledel's Gilmore Girls co-star, Scott Patterson — who plays Luke Danes — accidentally revealed that she and Kartheiser had just welcomed a baby boy. "She's really blossomed as a woman and now she's a proud new mother and married and happy," the actor said of reuniting with Bledel for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life back in 2016. "We're comparing notes because my son is about a year and a half older than her young son. I'm showing her photos and videos and what to expect. We're just really enjoying each other’s company."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Milo Ventimiglia And Hayden Panettiere?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-vincent-kartheiser-file-for-divorce-from-alexis-bledel>Why Did Vincent Kartheiser File For Divorce From Alexis Bledel?</h2><p>Us Weekly was the first to report the couple's divorce.
