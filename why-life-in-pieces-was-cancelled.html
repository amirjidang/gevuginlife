Given the fact that so many fantastic TV shows have been produced over that period of time and <a href=#>new shows that are great come out every year</a>, it seems pretty clear that is the truth. With that in mind, it is obvious that TV viewers everywhere should be quite thankful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best TV Dramas Of The Past 30 Years, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><p>Believe it or not, there actually is a downside to the fact that the world is in a golden age of television. After all, since there is so much great television these days, there are some <a href=#>extremely entertaining shows that have flown under the radar</a>. For example, some people have no idea that Life in Pieces was such an incredibly entertaining show. On the other hand, anyone who knows that Life in Pieces was fantastic must have one main question, why was the show canceled?</p><h2 id=what-made-life-in-pieces-so-great>What Made Life In Pieces So Great</h2><p>Throughout the vast majority of television history, the landscape was absolutely dominated by the top networks. While that wasn’t all bad, the networks dominating had some negative side effects including the fact that most shows were unoriginal. After all, whenever a show came out and became a hit, all of the networks rushed to produce shows that were extremely similar plotwise and in tone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Shows/Movies That Shamelessly Copied Each Other</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for TV viewers who are looking for something more unique, once smaller networks like HBO came to the forefront, more daring series began to be produced. Furthermore, now that streaming services like <a href=#>Netflix</a> exist, there is a lot more experimentation. However, when it comes to the biggest networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox, most of their shows are still pretty unoriginal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surprisingly enough, CBS produced and aired Life in Pieces from 2015 until 2019. A much more daring show than most of CBS’ other series, Life in Pieces often touched on topics that pushed the envelope. On top of that, the fact that each episode of Life in Pieces was told as four short stories that would typically come together, in the end, allowed it to stand out.</p><p>While it is wonderful that Life in Pieces was more original than most network shows, that alone isn’t enough to make it a good series. Fortunately, however, from the moment the show started, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life in Pieces got good reviews</a>. The reason for that is two-fold. After all, a lot of viewers really enjoyed the show’s storylines and Life in Pieces starred a talented cast, most of whom seemed to take a lot of pride in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-life-in-pieces-was-canceled>Why Life In Pieces Was Canceled</h2><p>From 2015 until 2019, four seasons of Lide in Pieces that consisted of 79 episodes were aired. Sadly for the show’s devoted fans, at the same time CBS announced that the Murphy Brown revival was canceled, the network revealed that Life in Pieces’ fourth season would be its last. At the time of that announcement, Life in Pieces’ fourth season hadn’t even begun airing yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Funny TV Shows To Binge (And Where To Watch Them Today)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that CBS didn’t wait to get a look at how Life in Pieces’ fourth season performed in the ratings, the show’s cancelation left fans wanting to know why the show ended so early. According to Wikipedia, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life in Pieces was canceled for “a combination of factors”</a>. Some of those reasons include “declining ratings, CBS's desire to have an ownership stake, and the network needing to clear space in getting four new sitcoms in the fall 2019 and mid-season schedule”.</p><h2 id=the-reaction-to-life-in-pieces-rsquo-cancelation>The Reaction To Life In Pieces’ Cancelation</h2><p>When some shows come to an end, most viewers are relieved. For example, at this point, it seems pretty clear that most people who’ve watched The Goldbergs think the show needs to end. Alternatively, when it comes to shows that fans feel ended prematurely, that is the kind of thing that makes viewers disappointed. Still, even when it comes to most shows that fans think ended prematurely, viewers are sad to see them go but they are forgotten before long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever since Life in Pieces was canceled, there have been consistent calls for the show to be revived. For example, there is a change.org petition demanding that Like in Pieces returns with almost 5,000 signatures. While that may seem like a small number, it is pretty impressive when put in the proper perspective. After all, the vast majority of people would never sign a petition like that thinking it will never work. Furthermore, it seems like most of the people who signed the petition did so because they sought something like it out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, it seems likely that Life in Pieces fans aren’t the only ones who would like the show to come back. After all, the show’s creator Justin Adler has revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life in Pieces' final episode to date was “never designed as a series finale”</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 TV Shows That Need To End ASAP (And 10 To Bring Back)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobansYyipWaomZqwpr%2BMsJisZZOWu6Sxy6WcnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./worst-dressed-grammys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Worst Dressed Grammys: Shocking Red Carpet Looks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-william-moseley-find-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is William Moseley?
