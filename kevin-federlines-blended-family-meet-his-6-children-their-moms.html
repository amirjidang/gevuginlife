The DJ has six children with<a href=#><strong> Shar Jackson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Victoria Prince</strong></a>.</p><p>The California native became a father in July 2002 when he and the Moesha alum welcomed their daughter, Kori. The pair were broken up by the time their son, Kaleb, arrived in July 2004, and <a href=#>Federline was in a relationship with the Princess of Pop</a>.</p><p>The actress revealed at the time that their split “wasn’t just breaking up a relationship … [but] breaking up a family,” which Federline apologized for during Celebrity Fit Club in April 2010.</p><p>“’I know I’ve caused you a lot of pain,” the former backup dancer told his ex at the time. “I’ve been really selfish. I guess I got so wrapped up in all this other s–t that I never really got a chance to sit back and apologize to you. I really do want you to know that I am sorry.”</p><p>Jackson replied, “I felt like the whole relationship was not real by the way you handled it ending — and that killed me.”</p><p>When Federline continued to apologize, noting that he “got caught up in [his] own selfishness,” the Celebrity Rap Superstar alum told him that his words “meant the world” to her.</p><p>As for the Excess Baggage alum and Spears, the duo wed in October 2004 but finalized their divorce three years later. Ahead of calling it quits, the former couple <a href=#>welcomed sons Sean Preston and Jayden in September 2005 and 2006</a>, respectively.</p><p>The Crossroads star, who has since moved on with fiancé<a href=#><strong> Sam Asghari</strong></a>,<a href=#> complimented Jackson’s daughter on her drawing skills</a> in a March 2022 Instagram post.</p><p>“My son’s stepsister drew this!!!” the songwriter captioned a photo of a sketch at the time. “Kori … she makes me feel so stupid. I think she was 12 when she did this. I’ve kept it all this time. She did it by hand not tracing!!! I would get a 40 percent F if I got graded on drawing!!! I respect people who can draw like this. My son can do the same thing. I mean wow. Wow!!!”</p><p>Jackson commented on the social media upload: “So crazy you posted this now because she’s working on a new one for you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to the Massachusetts native and Spears, Federline has two daughters with Prince. The pair <a href=#>wed in August 2013 in Las Vegas</a>. Two years before their nuptials, the couple welcomed daughter Jordan. Peyton was born in April 2014.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see photos of Federline’s family members over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuKbCyKdkn52Umr%2Bttc2eqmaanJq7pbHDZp2apZmhxm65xJ6rZqCZqHp3ecKhoKWcopq7bsDHnqCrZZ2kurR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-vogt-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Vogt Net Worth How Much Is Kyle Vogt Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kendall-jenner-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kendall Jenner Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
