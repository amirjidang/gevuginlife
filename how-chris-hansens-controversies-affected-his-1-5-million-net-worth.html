The series, which revolves around sting operations to catch pedophiles, made its host, <strong>Chris Hansen</strong>, into a star, as well as a de facto icon for self-styled "pedophile hunters".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Fans Are Still Worried About The Matt Lauer And Brooke Nevils Controversy</a></span></p><p>It should come as little surprise that the man behind myriad sting operations has been subject to seemingly endless controversies. In addition to the ethical dilemma of using serious crimes as entertainment, Hansen has found himself on the receiving end of various lawsuits, arrests, and legal troubles, all of which have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dampened&nbsp;his impressive net worth</a>. Here's how Chris Hansen's controversies have affected his $1.5 million net worth.</p><h2 id=how-did-chris-hansen-acquire-his-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>How Did Chris Hansen&nbsp;Acquire&nbsp;His Net Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As host of To Catch a Predator,&nbsp;Chris Hansen effectively became a pop culture hero, as well as somewhat of a meme. The show's distinctive, winning formula has been parodied incessantly. Hansen himself even guest starred in&nbsp;The Simpsons'&nbsp;season 22 episode "Loan-a Lisa", in which he catches Homer returning used goods to the mall.</p><p>Like many other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV hosts</a>, Hansen was handsomely paid&nbsp;for the hit show. At the height of his fame, he was estimated to have a net worth between&nbsp;$12-$15 million. However, that number has steadily decreased due to the host's innumerable controversies.</p><h2 id=a-to-catch-a-predator-suicide-damaged-hansen-s-reputation><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A 'To Catch A Predator' Suicide&nbsp;Damaged Hansen's Reputation</span></h2><p>In 2006, Chris Hansen faced a major blow to both his net worth and popularity. Louis Conradt, a Texas attorney, was caught posing as a teenager in order to allegedly procure sexual favors from a 13-year-old boy. Of course, the boy didn't actually exist and this persona was&nbsp;concocted as&nbsp;a ruse by Hansen and his colleagues to&nbsp;apprehend&nbsp;Conradt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Working with long time collaborators Perverted-Justice, an anti-predator organization, Hansen was able to catch Conradt having inappropriate conversations with the "boy" and a SWAT team&nbsp;stormed&nbsp;his property. However, Conradt shot himself once the police entered, dying shortly after.</p><h2 id=the-incident-saw-him-face-a-hefty-lawsuit><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Incident Saw Him Face A Hefty Lawsuit</span></h2><p>Following&nbsp;Conradt's death, his sister, Patricia, filed a lawsuit against Hansen and NBC. She sought $109 million in damages, claiming that To Catch a Predator was responsible for her brother's death. To make matters worse, NBC aired the episode despite Conradt's suicide.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Want Wendy Williams Canceled: 10 Times She's Taken Things Too Far</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, the lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but the damage to Hansen's reputation was already done. However, the host was adamant that his team had made the right decision in trying to catch&nbsp;Conradt, telling VladTV that the attorney had numerous images of child pornography on his computer. "While you don't want to see anything like that happen to a guy, suicide, you could pretty much clearly assume that he didn't want to face the music," Hansen explained.</p><h2 id=he-lost-his-job-during-the-fallout><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Lost His Job&nbsp;During&nbsp;The Fallout</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another blow to Chris Hansen's net worth came in in 2007 when To Catch a Predator was officially canceled in the fallout of the Conradt lawsuit. Though his salary has never been publicly revealed, Hansen is believed to have made millions from the show. Since&nbsp;To Catch a Predator was his livelihood, its cancelation would be the catalyst for a series of ensuing&nbsp;financial&nbsp;troubles.</p><h2 id=he-wrote-13-000-worth-of-bad-checks-to-fund-his-controversial-new-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Wrote $13,000 Worth Of Bad Checks To Fund His Controversial New Show</span></h2><p>In an effort to&nbsp;initiate&nbsp;his new project, entitled Hansen vs. Predator, Chris Hansen began a Kickstarter in 2015. The funding goal was $400,000, but he was only able to raise a measly $89,000.</p><p>Testament to his financial decline, Hansen resorted to writing bad checks&nbsp;to purchase promotional items for the show, amounting to $13,000. Accordingly, he was arrested and due to appear in court. Much to Hansen's relief, the case was dismissed in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-owed-hundreds-of-thousands-in-back-taxes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Owed Hundreds Of Thousands In Back Taxes</span></h2><p>Hansen's dire financial situation continued in 2019. As reported by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, he owed $250,000 in back taxes, as well as $60,000 to American Express, and several hundred thousand dollars to his bank and mortgage provider.&nbsp;Shockingly, the total debt amounted to&nbsp;over $1 million.</p><h2 id=things-went-downhill-when-he-tried-to-expose-youtuber-onision><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Things Went Downhill When He Tried To&nbsp;Expose YouTuber Onision</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Onision is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most hated YouTubers of all time</a>. The vlogger has long faced accusations of grooming minors, so he was a prime target for Chris Hansen. Despite his various financial woes, Hansen has never given up his quest to expose predators. After interviewing several women who alleged that they had been abused by Onision, Hansen set out to expose the vlogger.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Enraged After James Charles Interacts With Another Minor On Instagram</a></span></p><p>In 2020, he arrived at Onision's home in an attempt to&nbsp;question him about longstanding pedophilia claims. Onision immediately called the police,&nbsp;alleging&nbsp;that Hansen had been harassing and stalking him relentlessly. "There's a person who's been stalking me online, and they just showed up to my house," he said in a 911 call.</p><h2 id=onision-filed-a-lawsuit-against-hansen><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Onision Filed A Lawsuit Against Hansen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The attempted sting on Onision did not go according to plan and, yet again, Chris Hansen faced a lawsuit when the YouTuber sued him in January 2020. Mounting legal bills saw Hansen's already waning net worth decline even further.&nbsp;As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>, Hansen&nbsp;requested that his substantial court fees be covered, but the&nbsp;plea&nbsp;was denied.</p><p>While the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, the damage to Hansen's net worth was colossal.</p><h2 id=he-skipped-court-after-a-sting-operation-that-caught-3-alleged-predators><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Skipped Court After A Sting Operation That Caught 3 Alleged Predators</span></h2><p>The many controversies of&nbsp;To Catch a Predator&nbsp;haven't stopped Chris Hansen from continually pursuing sting operations on suspected pedophiles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2020, Hansen was involved in an operation to apprehend 3 men who had been planning to meet underage girls. The men were successfully arrested and awaited trial. But in a bizarre twist, Hansen skipped court after being subpoenaed to testify. Accordingly, a warrant was put out for his arrest and Hansen eventually turned himself in.</p><h2 id=there-are-rumors-that-he-s-in-financial-ruin-but-he-won-t-stop-trying-to-catch-predators><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>There Are Rumors That He's In Financial Ruin, But He Won't Stop Trying To Catch Predators</span></h2><p>Despite claims that To Catch a Predator&nbsp;was sensationalizing and capitalizing on predatory behavior, Hansen's recent efforts to apprehend alleged abusers suggest that money is not his incentive after all.</p><p>Subsequently, Hansen's post-Predator&nbsp;controversies have seen his net worth plummet from an estimated $12-15 million to just $1.5 million. For some people, the pursuit of justice is more important than the acquisition of money, even if Hansen's&nbsp;modus operandi&nbsp;is often highly controversial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Still Angry That Kate Winslet Worked With This Controversial Director</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLWztdJmn5qmo5q7tHnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2FyJ6qZpmWm7KkwMSdZKGho2J%2BboGMpqClpJmku266xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-pronounce-idris-elba.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to pronounce idris elba</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-taylor-swift-is-the-perfect-role-model.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Taylor Swift Is The Perfect Role Model</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
