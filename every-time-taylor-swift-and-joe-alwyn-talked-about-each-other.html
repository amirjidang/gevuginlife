Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn don't speak much about their relationship, but when they do, the world listens. <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift </a></strong>has been infamously tagged as a “serial dater” for at least half of her career. But ever since the Kimye scandal back in 2016, the "Blank Space" songwriter decided to live a quiet life, attempting to stay out of the limelight at all costs, and for a good reason. This includes her relationship with her long-time beau, Joe Alwyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple allegedly <a href=#>first crossed paths</a> back in May 2016 at the Vogue's Met Gala, but it wasn’t until January 2017 that Taylor finally confirmed that she and the Harriet actor were dating. According to Glamour, The "Look What You Made Me Do" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singer set the record straight </a>that she “wants it to stay that way because I don’t want anything about this to change or become too complicated or intruded upon.”</p><p>It seems like everything is in accordance with her plan since their first paparazzi shots were taken five months after she confirmed their relationship. Taylor has hardly talked about their relationship in public since, but when she does, the world can’t stop gushing about it.</p><h2 id=how-taylor-swift-and-joe-alywn-maintain-their-relationship><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Taylor Swift And Joe Alywn Maintain Their Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "Cardigan" singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first talked about her relationship with Joe Alwyn </a>when she sat down with The Guardian talking about her feuds, fame, and political stand. When asked about why she and Alwyn are rarely photographed together, she said, “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”</p><p>She then added, “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world.

At that time, Taylor felt a little lonely, saying, “I didn’t have a partner that I climbed [that mountain] with that I could high-five. I didn’t have anyone I could talk to that could relate to it. I had my mom, but I just wondered…Shouldn’t there be someone I could call right now?”</p><p>After dating Joe Alwyn, she then said that they have “decided together” to keep their relationship private. “Even though it was [a] really horrible [time], I was happy.

And he's always the person who's showing me songs by artists and then they become my favorite songs or whatever. But yeah, ‘Champagne Problems,’ that was one of my favorite bridges to write.
