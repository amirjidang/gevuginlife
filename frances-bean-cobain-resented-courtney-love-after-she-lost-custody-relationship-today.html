From the outside looking in, it certainly seems like one of the hardest things that Love coped with is losing custody of her daughter Frances Bean Cobain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the moment that Cobain was born, she has been under a magnifying glass to a certain degree. As a result of that, a lot of <a href=#>interesting facts are known about Cobain</a> and there are still a lot of people who focus on <a href=#>what her life is like to this day</a>.</p><p>On top of the interest in how Cobain lives her life in general, many people are fascinated by Cobain's relationship with her mother. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what is the state of Cobain and Love's relationship now?</p><h2 id=why-did-courtney-love-lost-custody-of-her-daughter-frances-bean-cobain>Why Did Courtney Love Lost Custody Of Her Daughter Frances Bean Cobain?</h2><p>Throughout most of history, it was pretty clear that the majority of people have been uneducated about the realities of addiction. Most notably, many people have been unaware of how easy it can be for anyone to become addicted to illicit substances and how difficult it is to break free of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain-and-courtney-love-looking-distant.jpg><p>Due to high levels of ignorance about addiction, there is a long history of the masses looking down on people who are struggling. A perfect example of that is the fact that during periods when Courtney Love has clearly been struggling, she has been mocked by many in the media.</p><p>Looking back at the realities of what Love has gone through over the years, it seems very clear that what she needed was compassion.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kurt Cobain Was Worth $50 Million... His Daughter Feels Guilty About The Inheritance</a></span></p><p>No matter what Love may have needed in the past, the welfare of her daughter Frances Bean Cobain is of paramount importance. Tragically for everyone involved, that fact is the reason why Love lost custody of Cobain in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Six years before Love ultimately lost custody of Cobain, she was in danger of no longer being able being a parent to her daughter in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frances-bean-cobain-1.jpg><p>After the headlines about Love losing custody of Cobain first surfaced, TMZ fought to have files from the legal battle unsealed. According to TMZ's reporting, the fight over Cobain's custody included an allegation of "domestic violence" although it was unclear who was involved in that.</p><p>At the end of the day, it seems clear that there wasn't a single situation that directly led to Love losing custody. It also is worth noting that on top of taking her custody away, the judge also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">granted a restraining order</a> which prohibited Love from having any contact with Cobain at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-courtney-love-close-with-her-daughter-frances-bean-cobain-now>Is Courtney Love Close With Her Daughter Frances Bean Cobain Now?</h2><p>When celebrities have kids, a lot of people assume that those children are fortunate in every way, and it is easy to see why that is the case. After all, celebrity kids have lots of advantages in life including getting a lot of opportunities which is why some of them even <a href=#>surpass their parent's success</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-frances-bean-cobain-have-to-go-back-to-work-after-blowing-through-11-million-of-kurt-cobain-s-net-worth_.jpg><p>When it comes to Frances Bean Cobain, there is no doubt she has been fortunate in a lot of ways. After all, she inherited a lot of money from her father's estate. However, it also seems clear that she has been extremely unlucky in many ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Always in her parents' shadow, Cobain has spent years being asked about things like her father's legacy. On top of that, Cobain's relationship with her mother has clearly had more than its fair share of lowlights over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kurt Cobain’s Daughter Doesn’t “Really Like Nirvana That Much”</a></span></p><p>Despite the undisputed fact that Cobain's relationship with her mother has been difficult at times, it would be wonderful if the pair could have a happy ending together. However, since life isn't a fairytale, the important thing is what the reality of Cobain and Love's relationship is like today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain-and-courtney-love-all-dressed-up.jpg><p>Over the last several years, neither Love nor Cobain has spoken in public about their relationship. As a result, it is impossible to say for sure how close the mother and daughter pair is as of the time of this writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for anyone who is rooting for Love and Cobain's relationship, there is some very strong evidence that the pair have rebuilt their bond to a large degree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain-and-courtney-love-on-a-street-together.jpg><p>In 2015, a documentary titled Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck was released. During that period, Rolling Stone spoke to Frances Bean Cobain about the documentary and how it affected her. The resulting article revealed that when Love watched the documentary for the first time, she asked her daughter to be there with her.</p><p>While speaking to Rolling Stone, Cobain described watching the documentary on a sofa with Love. In a truly touching portion of the article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobain described watching the documentary with Love</a> as a "tender, rare [moment she] had with [her] mom".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain Deleted Her Twitter, What Is She Up To Now?</a></span></p><p>Cobain also described how Love reacted to a specific scene from the documentary. “My mother held me, cried on me and just said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry. Just kept saying it over and over. But then she said, ‘Do you realize how much your father loved you?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, I do.'”</p><p>Four years later in 2019, Cobain talked about Love during an appearance on the "RuPaul: What's the Tee?" podcast. To say that the way that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobain described her mom when she is at her best</a> is beautiful is an understatement.</p><p>"When my mom is on a right and healthy path, she is one of the most fulfilling, beautiful, intelligent and kind people I ever met. This is what I like to call the era of balance, and I hope that we're bringing in the era of balance."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain-and-courtney-love-paparazzi-photo.jpg><p>On top of the positive things that Cobain has said about Love, it also is important to note that the mother and daughter pair have been photographed together many times since the custody battle.</p><p>With everything in mind, it seems like there is only one question left to answer, what kind of space is Love in these days?</p><p>The reality of addiction is that Love and other people like her have to fight to stay sober every day.
