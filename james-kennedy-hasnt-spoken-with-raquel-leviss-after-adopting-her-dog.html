He’s amazing,” James gushed before Ally added, “He’s so great. I love him. He’s so happy and we have a yard. He’s been a great boy.”</p><p>After adopting the dog earlier this summer, James confirmed to Us that he hasn’t had any contact with ex <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>, who was Hippie’s previous owner.</p><p><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> viewers were introduced to Hippie <a href=#>when he was still called Graham Cracker</a>. During James and Raquel’s relationship, the former beauty pageant queen, 29, <a href=#>got the pet as a gift from her parents</a>. Raquel initially remained Graham’s primary guardian after <a href=#>ending her engagement to James in late 2021.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie.jpg><p>Earlier this year, Raquel made headlines for having an affair with costar <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>, which ended his nearly decade-long romance with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>. Raquel <a href=#>checked herself into a mental health facility</a> in the aftermath of the drama. While fans assumed that Raquel’s dog was in her family’s possession amid her 90-day stay, James later revealed <a href=#>he was looking after Graham now.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie-2.jpg><p>“Look who made his way back home, back into my life. I’ll take care of you forever, and I love you,” James captioned a July Instagram photo of him filming season 11 with his dog, <a href=#>who he later renamed Hippie</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> claimed at the time that her Vanderpump Dogs Rescue organization received word that the dog was in a rescue center, which is how James was able to gain custody. Raquel’s mother, Laura, however, clarified that <a href=#>an incident led to the decision to surrender</a> Graham to trainers at California Doodle Rescue. They later contacted Lisa, 63, without Laura’s knowledge or approval.</p><p>One month later, Raquel offered her side of the story about <a href=#>what led to Graham getting rehomed.</a></p><p>“There’s a lot more to this story, but Graham, my gosh. He has a history of aggression and he’s bitten me really hard. I already was considering getting a foster family while going into [the mental health facility] the Meadows and trying it out,” she said on <a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a>‘s iHeartRadio’s “ReWives” podcast in August.</p><p>Raquel claimed there was “a reason why” <a href=#>she didn’t want James to look after the dog</a>, adding, “He doesn’t have dog experience and he’s part of the reason why Graham is a biter. James would encourage Graham to bite his hands hard, and he liked that sensation, so of course that trained Graham to be a biter.”</p><p>According to Raquel, the choice to <a href=#>find Graham a new home came after she exhausted</a> other options.</p><p>“My dog Graham bit my mom’s hand down to the bone, and it was so bad she couldn’t even get stitches. I had the decision to either leave the Meadows and go back and take care of my dog, or try to get him rehomed and finish out my treatment, because I knew I had more to work on,” she continued. “So I chose myself and we researched a breed-specific dog rescue, and they took him in besides his biting behavior. Bottom line, he couldn’t get rehomed.”</p><p>The former reality star, who has since <a href=#>announced her departure from Vanderpump Rules</a>, was surprised to hear Lisa got involved with rehoming Graham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie-4.jpg><p>“It was supposed to be a confidential, anonymous [decision] because it’s nobody else’s business,” she added at the time. “I thought it was a joke at first [when I saw Graham with James]. My heart dropped to my stomach. There was a picture of James walking Graham, and I was like, ‘No.’ Immediately, my mom called the foster who was working with Graham, and she said, ‘Oh, it’s so lovely. Lisa adopted him.’ So now the narrative is, I dumped my dog at a shelter and he was hours away from being euthanized and that’s not true.”</p><p>Although Raquel has taken a step back from filming, James has enjoyed <a href=#>being in the spotlight after filming season 11.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The vibe was pretty intense after [our Vanderpump Rules panel]. I don’t think Sandoval had too much fun up there. I was having a great time,” James joked with Us after joining his costars onstage at BravoCon on Friday, November 3. “But yeah, it was an intense panel. … But we all got through it and I did think there were some funny parts.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGapZWoeqyxzaecnbFdna60utNmqqmnm5q7bsPIrZ9mqpGmwqa4jKWcr6GjqHqistOeqWaZlKS9tbXNoGShnaJisbCzjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-remar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-644590-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Remar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-deen-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Deen Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
