She won during the sixth season (at only 17 years old) and it was all uphill from there. At least, in some areas of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She had some high-profile relationship drama, achieved many musical milestones, and is now happily married to her husband Dana Isaiah, but <a href=#>it's been a long road</a>. So how did Dana and Jordin meet and wind up falling in love? It turns out they had a little bit of matchmaking help.</p><h2 id=who-did-jordin-sparks-date-before-dana-isaiah>Who Did Jordin Sparks Date Before Dana Isaiah?</h2><p>Jordin released multiple albums, appeared on TV and in movies, and just generally grew her personal brand. But she also made plenty of headlines for connecting with industry bad boy Jason Derulo after a few years in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was kind of an unexpected pairing, given the nature of Jason's music and whole stage persona (does the song 'Talk Dirty to Me' ring a bell?), and the fact that Jordin is a self-proclaimed religious person. There's also the fact that she had once worn a promise ring, but then admitted she had taken it off when she was dating Jason...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Knew Jason Derulo And Jena Frumes Would Split, Here’s Why</a></span></p><p>The high-profile couple's breakup was widely reported on, with Jordin later <a href=#>admitting that Jason dumped her</a> by... well, not dumping her at all. After that, fans had their fingers crossed that Jordin would find someone more aligned with her lifestyle, including what fans now know are her evangelical Christian beliefs.</p><p>Enter a special someone who got Jordin connected with the guy who turned out to be her soulmate.</p><h2 id=when-did-dana-isaiah-and-jordin-sparks-first-meet>When Did Dana Isaiah And Jordin Sparks First Meet?</h2><p>The story goes that Jordin and Dana Isaiah met by chance because of their families' connection. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online states</a> that Jordin met Dana's family at an event in February of 2017. Dana, who was hoping to move to Los Angeles and pursue his modeling goals, was then referred to Jordin by his parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Jordin Sparks' Husband Dana Isaiah, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><p>The goal wasn't to have the two date, though; Isaiah explained that his mom wanted Jordin to talk him out of moving to LA or entering the industry altogether. Jordin's mom helped connect the two via group text, and they started chatting.</p><p>Other sources say that the pair finally met in person in April of that year, and things sped up then!</p><h2 id=jordin-sparks-says-meeting-dana-isaiah-was-love-at-first-sight>Jordin Sparks Says Meeting Dana Isaiah Was Love At First Sight</h2><p>While Jordin and Dana had chatted for a while remotely, they eventually met in person, and Jordin admitted it was love at first sight for her. In fact, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Today in an interview</a> that they "connected on a deep platonic level" when they began talking. She even clarified that neither of them was looking for a relationship, and they had agreed on that fact.</p><p>But when Dana Isaiah knocked on her door? Jordin fell head over heels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explained that it was "literally" love at first sight and that she knew from the moment she met Dana in person that he was her soulmate. Of course, she didn't tell him that at the time -- but clearly, the two cleared the air pretty quickly.</p><h2 id=jordin-sparks-eloped-to-hawaii-with-dana-isaiah>Jordin Sparks Eloped To Hawaii With Dana Isaiah</h2><p>After meeting via text around February and connecting in person reportedly around April, Jordin and Dana eloped to Hawaii (with friends along for the nuptials) in July.

Jordin noted that she feels "comfort and safety and calm and peace" with her husband, something she had lacked in previous relationships.</p><p>And ever since, Jordin and her hubby have shared their relationship milestones and gushed over one another and their marriage on social media. From their babymoon/honeymoon trip to their little boy's milestones to Dana's book release and Jordin's new music, the two are forging an impressive path as a Hollywood power couple.</p><p>In fact, Jordin's been releasing new music in recent years that also involves her hubby's talents; he's starred in one of her music videos and, as Jordin explains, is her number one supporter when it comes to getting out of her comfort zone and doing amazing things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though their relationship seemed to progress quickly, Dana Isaiah and Jordin Sparks seem like a perfect match, and fans can't get enough of their adorable family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Isn’t The Richest ‘American Idol’ Winner, Here’s Who Is</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecmoqZ2hnmLAsa3RpKpmpZWawW601KyZmqaUYrGiusBmoKyZmZa1cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-pete-davidson-gay-lets-find-out-his-real-sexuality-592345-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Pete Davidson Gay?
