His career started in 1967.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Kevin Tighe is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Kevin`s net worth is as high as $2.5 million, earned through his career in the entertainment industry, during which he has made over 80 film and TV appearances. Also, he has worked in theater in such productions as “Curse of the Starving Class”, “Other Desert Cities”, “A Skull in Connemara”, and “A Reckoning”, among many others, which also improved his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kevin-tighe-net-worth-25-million></span>Kevin Tighe Net Worth $2.5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tighe grew up in nearby Pasadena, after his family moved there when he turned five. His father was an actor, and soon he followed in his footsteps, auditioning for roles of children in the Pasadena Playhouse, but then focused more on education, attending Pasadena High School and later Pasadena City College. After matriculation he enrolled at the University of Southern California, from which he graduated with an undergraduate degree and then master in fine arts. He subsequently spent two years in United States Army, stationed at Fort Knox.</p><p>His first role went uncredited – he was the student in Mike Nichols` “The Graduate” (1967), with Dustin Hoffman. Before the end of the `60s, Kevin featured in “Narcotics: Pit of Despair” (1967), and “Yours, Mine and Ours” (1968). In 1972 his luck smiled upon him as he was selected for the role of Paramedic Roy DeSoto in the TV series “Emergency”, which lasted until 1979, with s spin-off series also filmed entitled “Emergency +4” which aired between 1973-1974; Kevin appeared in 23 episodes in the same role. He was quite dedicated to the show, as he went on paramedic classes, among other activities that helped him to improve his acting as one of the emergency staff.</p><p>The show made him extremely popular, and certainly increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>After the show ended, he focused more on theater, but returned to the screen in 1987 with the role of Hickey in “Matewan”. Until the end of the `80s he featured in “Eight Men Out” (1988), starring John Cusack and Clifton Games, while in 1989 he had a supporting role next to Jim Belushi and Mel Harris in “K-9”. The same year he appeared in “Road House”, featuring Patrick Swayze and Kelly Lynch in lead roles.<br>From 1990 until 1995, Kevin made around 20 film appearances, some of the most notable ones included “City of Hope” (1991), “Face of a Stranger” (1991), “Newsies” (1992) with Christian Bale and Robert Duvall, “A Man in Uniform” (1993), “What`s Eating Gilbert Grape” (1993) starring Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliette Lewis, and “The Avenging Angel” (1995). He then made a few brief television appearances, but returned to the big screen in 1998 with the film “Wicnhell”, and continued with roles in “The Darwin Conspiracy” (1999), and “Mumford” (1999). His net worth grew steadily.</p><p>Kevin began the `90s with a role in the horror thriller “The Sight” next to Andrew McCarthy, and continued with roles in “Nancy Drew” (2002) and “A Life in Suitcases” (2005). In 2009 he had a role in Patrick Lussier`s “My Bloody Valentine” (2009), while four years later he had a supporting role in “I Am I”, with Simon Helberg and Jason Ritter. Most recently he appeared in five episodes of the TV series “Complications” (2015), and he is also working on the film “Spirit Water”, but the film is yet to receive a release date.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Kevin has been married to Rebecca Ann Fletcher since 1995. Previously, he was married to Mary Lou Seaman from 1968 until 1971; the couple had a daughter, actress Jennifer Tighe.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kevin Tighe</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 13, 1944</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.85 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Pasadena High School, Pasadena City College, University of Southern California, United States Army</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rebecca Tighe (m. 1995), Mary Lou Seaman (m. 1968–1971)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jennifer Tighe</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001798/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kevin-tighe-mn0001752087</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Emergency” (1972-1979), “What`s Eating Gilbert Grape” (1993), “Another 48 Hrs” (1990), “City of Hope” (1991), “Face of a Stranger” (1991), “Newsies” (1992), “A Man in Uniform” (1993), “What`s Eating Gilbert Grape” (1993), “The Avenging Angel” (1995)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Emergency!, Rose Red, Murder One, The Wedsworth-Townsend Act, Emergency +4</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>[on his professional on- and off-screen chemistry with Julie London and Bobby Troup, who played both Dixie ‘Dix’ McCall, RN & Dr. Joe Early, M.D., respectively]: Working with Julie and Bobby.
