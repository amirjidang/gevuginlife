Taking to social media, Daz uploaded a video refuting Knight’s assertion that he and his crew were envious of Pac.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As part of his defense, the Long Beach, Calif. native argued that Death Row’s producers and artists both helped make Shakur into the megastar he ultimately became after joining the label. “Yo, I got a problem with this,” Daz said of the growing theme of Snoop and Tha Dogg Pound’s disdain for the Hip-Hop icon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-74308078.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“People always saying that Snoop. Dr. Dre, us, everybody — we was jealous of <a href=# id=auto-tag_2pac data-tag=2pac>2Pac</a>. How can we be jealous of 2Pac and we made 2Pac?” he asked, noting their respective roles in the making of Shakur’s Death Row debut All Eyez On Me, which became <a href=#>his most successful release</a> to date.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We put that album together,” he added. “We came over there, we gave him music. We did that. We wanted him to be the man of the man, so how was we jealous putting his album together? Taking songs from us and giving it to him — how is that jealousy?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Daz then accused Suge Knight of creating “confusion” within the Death Row ranks, pointing to Knight’s polarizing declarations on<a href=#> his Collect Call podcast</a>, the platform on which he initially charged his former artists with turning against Pac.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1598388.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The only jealousy there was, was Suge Knight in his ear and everybody[‘s] ear causing confusion. Look at that muthaf**ka now. All on his little podcast always talking sh*t. Kill that noise! Tha Dogg Pound, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre none of us — we was never jealous of 2Pac.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The veteran boardsman concluded by voicing his belief that if anyone was envious of anyone, it was Knight himself, as the mogul is currently incarcerated on a manslaughter conviction and has lost ownership and control of Death Row Records.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We could go out in the streets and hang out and do what the f**k we wanna do. He was limited for what he had to do,” Daz said of Pac’s obligations during that period. “And we was the one that was producing and creating a masterpiece, All Eyez On Me. So who’s jealous? I think Suge Knight was jealous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-495183251.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Suge Knight has been open about his belief that Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre. and other Death Row acts appeared bothered by Shakur’s popularity and fame in comparison to their own on multiple occasions. The 58-year-old has even asserted that Snoop and other members of his crew collaborated with participants in Pac’s 1996 drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, resulting in his death.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Daz Dillinger’s Instagram post below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muu3nDoqOloZ6csrN5yZ6YpaelqHq1wc%2BammZqoJawbn2RbGtxbGZqf3Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-thomas-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-585901-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Thomas Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-cabral-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danielle Cabral Net Worth How Much Is Danielle Cabral Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
