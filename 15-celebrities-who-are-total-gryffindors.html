(Hey, J.K. Rowling made the House sound too good NOT to want to be a part of.) Gryffindor House is often held up as the best of the best, where jocks and brains alike can find a place to call home. Known for their nerve, chivalry, daring, courage, bravery, and determination, Gryffindors are often the leaders among witches and wizards (like Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall), but they can also be a little showy in their partiality to grand gestures—just look at pretty much anything Harry Potter has ever done! Sometimes, however, it leads to them making snap decisions that don’t always turn out for the best (which is why we need a Gryffindor like Hermione around to keep things in control). Since everyone wants to be in Gryffindor, which is held up by many as the pinnacle of Hogwarts Houses, we might find some of our trail-blazing faves among these 15 celebrities!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Ben Affleck</span></h2><p>One of the most famous leading men in Hollywood, Ben Affleck just seems to fit what it means to be a Gryffindor; which includes being daring and brave (as we often see him in all his heroic, chin-dimpled glory in period pieces, Marvel movies, and tense thrillers). Plus, he’s played a superhero on the big screen! (Although to be fair, that performance wasn’t exactly well received.) Affleck has also seen most of his success stepping behind the camera, like in his Oscar-winning turn for Argo, which has the leadership quality of a Gryffindor. Since he’s been in the spotlight for quite a while, Affleck has also gotten a bit of the Hollywood bug in regards to showboating, which Gryffindors are notorious for, because they can’t help but love the glory that their accomplishments give them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-damon><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Matt Damon</span></h2><p>Ben Affleck’s best friend, Matt Damon, is also a guy who totally belongs in Godric Gryffindor’s House, although the two aren’t exactly Harry and Ron. One of the highest-grossing actors of all time and considered one of the most bankable stars by Forbes, Damon is another leading man who has ingrained his hero image into pop culture so it’s difficult to differentiate the man from the characters he plays. However, Matt actually is a bit of a hero in real life. As the founder of H2O Africa Foundation and Not On Our Watch Project, the latter of which focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities like those in Darfur. He also seems relaxed in the spotlight, without craving its glow, which is the mark of a Gryffindor who knows exactly how to ~werk it~ for the cameras without being too proud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><p>Emma Stone could be just as at home in Ravenclaw, but we have a feeling that this fiery redhead would pick Gryffindor if given the choice. And it seems like most people agree with us (at least where the Internet is concerned). Intelligent and beautiful, Emma is usually tasked with playing some fierce female characters that truly test her range, which is why we think she’d get along just fine with all the other Gryffindors in Gryffindor Tower. Considered one of the most talented actresses of her generation, Emma has collected a slew of awards and accolades, and any Gryffindor will tell us that there’s just something about having a stack of shiny trophies to mark our accomplishments, because even if daring, nerve, and chivalry make Gryffindors the best, statuettes help, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chrissy-teigen><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Chrissy Teigen</span></h2><p>Okay, look, we know that Chrissy Teigen could totally work in Hufflepuff, because she’s friendly, likeable as hell, and is also super obsessed with food. (Seriously, she might even be able to put Helga Hufflepuff to shame, who was known for her expertise in food charms.) However, Chrissy is actually a total Gryffindor, which can be seen in her Twitter feed! Unwilling to take sh*t from anyone, Chrissy is the queen of the clap-back and will eviscerate any Internet troll who dares to come at her or her family. She’s also totally willing to be vocal about her political beliefs, which include a heavy dose of anti-Trumpism. And in an industry where many celebrities may refrain from speaking their minds, Chrissy brings out her mama lion and goes for the jugular. A true Gryffindor to say the least.</p><h2 id=maisie-williams><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Maisie Williams</span></h2><p>Not only does she play the kind of ass-kicking heroine who’s already inspired tons of little girls everywhere, but Maisie Williams is totally a Gryffindor in real life! As the tomboyish Arya, Maisie has been able to cut down a ton of enemies in her path from a young age, wielding Needle with the kind of skill that many experienced swordsmen would envy. To be drawn to that kind of character is the mark of a Gryffindor for sure, because what other House could pull off such a fierce role? Especially since it was young Maisie’s first professional role, and she’s said more than a few times in interviews that she can relate to Arya (which sounds more than a little scary!). Like some other Gryffindors (ahem, Fred and George), Maisie’s a bit of a jokester too, regularly ribbing her costars, including real life BFF Sophie Turner, aka Sansa Stark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shailene-woodley><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Shailene Woodley</span></h2><p>A total hippie, Shailene Woodley is as down with Mother Earth as she is with Godric Gryffindor! An avid environmentalist, Woodley has stated time and time again her beliefs about health and the environment (some of which are dubious, like giving our lady parts some vitamin D), but unlike many celebrities, Woodley has put her words into action. In a major Gryffindor move, Woodley took part in the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and was even arrested for her efforts! That bravery and nerve is the mark of a Gryffindor for sure, especially with their need to stand up and do the right thing (which dovetails with the Hufflepuff’s trait of being just). Sounds to us like Woodley’s work has earned her a seat at the Gryffindor table!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Katy Perry</span></h2><p>The woman has a song called “Roar.” Do we really need more of a reason as to why she’s a Gryffindor? Okay, how about the fact that a bunch of self-proclaimed Gryffindor girls co-opted the song into a parody about Gryffindor? Nope? Still not good enough? How about the fact that she’s used her voice and fame to support organizations aimed at aiding those suffering from cancer and HIV, been an outspoken activist for LGBT+ rights, and has been incredibly vocal about her identification as a feminist, something female celebrities still tiptoe around. Consistently using her voice and the glory she’s earned as a recording artist, Katy Perry is the kind of Gryffindor who would definitely earn more than a few awards to be cleaned by Ron in the Trophy Room.</p><h2 id=alicia-keys><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alicia Keys</span></h2><p>Alicia Keys is definitely smart enough to earn a spot in Ravenclaw, but her fearlessness in speaking out about how women are “brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect” takes some big Gryffindor balls! Adding to this, Alicia has explained, “I don’t want to cover up anymore. Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to being a brave lioness in her personal life, Alicia has also been dedicated to philanthropy and social activism, with her Keep A Child Alive NPO that provides medical help to families suffering from HIV and AIDS in Africa, and most recently as one of the key speakers during the Women’s March on Washington. This Gryffindor girl is definitely on fire!</p><h2 id=adele><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Adele</span></h2><p>With a powerhouse voice, Adele’s sheer presence is that of a Gryffindor. She’s bold, unafraid to speak her mind, and will come at her haters in a way that isn’t too aggressive and, in fact, makes us love her even more. (Just recently, she called out a security guard who ordered her concertgoers to stop dancing!) She’s also been able to build a career out of song lyrics that we can all relate to, and the subject matter of those songs is deeply personal and emotional in a way that definitely earns her some acknowledgment of her bravery—even if it’s not the swashbuckling sword type that’s usually attributed to Gryffindors. Plus, remember when people made an issue about her weight, as though that had any impact on her talent? She sure as hell shut those haters down, like any lion would!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-winslet><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kate Winslet</span></h2><p>While we’ve talked about actors who are fierce in personality or often appear as heroes in films, Kate Winslet is an ACTUAL hero! (Plus, she’s pretty fierce when it comes to speaking honestly about the pressures women in Hollywood face as they age.) While staying with her family at billionaire Richard Branson’s private island home, lightning struck the house and set it ablaze. Kate, putting on her superhero’s cape, first made sure that her own children were out safely before heading back to rescue Branson’s 90-year-old mother, Eve, from the fire! Branson was very grateful, blogging, “Many thanks to Kate Winslet for helping to carry my 90-year-old mum out of the main house to safety.” If daring, nerve, and chivalry are what define a Gryffindor, then it seems like Kate has got it in spades!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=viola-davis><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Viola Davis</span></h2><p>The only black woman to be nominated for three Academy Awards (before finally winning for her role in Fences), Viola Davis is definitely a Gryffindor, and not just because she regularly plays strong, complex women in her career. A trailblazer throughout her work, Davis was also the first black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, but it took a lot of work to get there. Living through a tough childhood, Davis was only two years old when she was arrested with her mother during a Civil Rights protest, and it outspoken about civil rights and political activism, especially in such an explosive political climate. A badass lady who wears red like she owns the color, Viola Davis is a clear choice for Gryffindor!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Oprah</span></h2><p>Another monumentally successful woman who endured a rough upbringing, Oprah is one of the most recognized faces in the world. While her success and ambition might seem like the work of a Slytherin, Oprah is a total Gryffindor with her good heart and her leadership qualities, which everyone knows is the hallmark of a Gryffindor gal. The richest African-American, the greatest black philanthropist in American history, and North America’s first and only multi-billionaire black person, Oprah has an astounding list of achievements that put her in good company with Godric Gryffindor, who was considered the most accomplished dueller of his time and an enlightened fighter against Muggle discrimination. Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, Oprah would earn a rightful spot at Gryffindor table.</p><h2 id=beyonc><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Beyoncé</span></h2><p>We&nbsp;KNOW Beyoncé has to be a Gryffindor! Many houses may try to claim her as their own, but Queen Bey is the kind of royalty that belongs to the House of red and gold (plus she looks incredible in those colors). Multi-talented and repeatedly rewarded, practically a national hero and one who is regularly pointed to as being a savior of the music industry, everyone knows that heroes and saviors can be found most frequently in Gryffindor! Also, being able to pull off stage shows like she does–especially while pregnant–definitely requires some nerve and bravery, so two more reasons why Bey would be right at home embracing her inner lion. Plus, she won’t let the market dictate what she will and will not put into her music–just look at Lemonade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=malala-yousafzai><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Malala Yousafzai</span></h2><p>Well, come ON! Of course Malala would be sorted into Gryffindor! Sure, she’s incredibly brilliant and well spoken, the kind of young women who puts the rest of us to shame with her wisdom and eloquence–all of which puts her nicely into Ravenclaw–but her bravery is remarkable and a clear reason why she belongs in the company of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate, she survived attempted murder by a Taliban gunman at the age of 15, recovered and became an advocate and activist for human rights, women’s rights, and education. Before that happened, however, Malala was writing blogs for the BBC that covered the Taliban influence in Swat, a district of Pakistan. She was only 11. Sounds like one other special Gryffindor we know who triumphed in the face of adversity, against all the odds! Welcome to Gryffindor, Malala!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barack-obama><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Barack Obama</span></h2><p>As likeable as a Hufflepuff, as intelligent as a Ravenclaw, and as ambitious as a Slytherin, former President Barack Obama could belong to any House at Hogwarts, but we know that at his core, he’s a Gryffindor. Being able to handle his eight-year, two-term presidency with grace while simultaneously bringing his country out of an economic depression, defeating and executing Bin Laden, and providing Americans with affordable health care are just some of the feats Obama was able to accomplish while in office. And doing so made him a national hero for many people. In fact, even during his first run for office, in which his slogan was “Yes We Can” and his posters proclaimed the word “Hope,” it seems like Obama was a Gryffindor all along, defying expectations and entering into the minds of many as a golden boy. So, yeah, he’s definitely a Gryffindor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LEqbuMmqmeZaSkwaK4jKCpsp6Wnrulu9GsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-crazy-fan-theories-on-the-sopranos-you-never-heard-about.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Crazy Fan Theories On The Sopranos You Never Heard About</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./winter-house-premiere-alex-propson-makes-move-on-jordan-danielle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Winter House' Premiere: Alex Propson Makes Move on Jordan, Danielle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
