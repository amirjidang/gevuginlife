After that, Zumann managed to beat the odds by landing roles in several notable projects that garnered a lot of fans.</p><p>Since Zumann's career took off in his teens, that left fans wondering how things would play out for the actor. After all, a lot of young actors fall into <a href=#>the pitfalls of being child stars</a>, but there are some examples of <a href=#>former teen stars who've become major movie stars</a> as adults.</p><p>Most recently, however, Zumann seems to have mostly taken a step back from his acting career. With that in mind, many of Zumann's fans have lost track of what the actor has been up to and they have no idea what category of former teen star he will become a part of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-lucas-jade-zumann-become-famous>How Did Lucas Jade Zumann Become Famous?</h2><p>When moviegoers look at the Hollywood system from afar, there are a lot of aspects of the business that are perplexing. A perfect example of that is the powers that be in Hollywood seem to look down on horror movies as evidenced by the fact that they very rarely win awards or even get nominated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucas-jade-zumann-from-anne-with-an-e.jpg><p>Despite the fact that horror movies don't get enough respect, they are a huge part of the film industry. After all, there are millions of passionate horror fans and there has been a long tradition of famous actors making their film debuts in horror movies before moving on to other roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Actors Who Made Their Film Debuts In Horror Movies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Jamie Lee Curtis, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Johnny Depp, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Lucas Jade Zumann made his movie debut in a scary movie. In 2015, horror fans got to see Zumann on the big screen for the first time when he starred in Sinister 2.</p><p>Still in his mid-teens at the time, Zumann played an important role in Sinister 2. Unfortunately for everyone involved with Sinister 2, the movie was far from a critical darling. However, considering that IMDb reports that Sinister 2 cost $10 million to produce, and it brought in more than $53 million at the box office, it was a big financial success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucas-jade-zumann-in-20th-century-women.jpg><p>After launching his career in horror, Zumann quickly transitioned into dramatic roles when he starred in 20th Century Women. In that acclaimed film, Zumann held his own with his co-stars Annette Bening, Billy Crudup, Greta Gerwig, and Elle Fanning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, Zumann's impressive 20th Century Women resulted in him landing the role that many people know him for today. During a 2018 interview with tv-eh.com, Zumann revealed that his 20th Century Women performance <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">landed him a starring role in Anne with an E</a>.</p><p>"When I got the offer for the audition, I was on tour for the publicity for 20th Century Women, a film that I did. And the director of 20th Century Women worked with the producer of Anne with an E. She liked the film. She saw the film early and she liked my work and she requested that I read for the role."</p><p>"So I came in, the first thing I did was actually a chemistry read with Amybeth McNulty." Zumann continued, "And then after that point, it was maybe a couple of weeks before my agent called me and let me know that I had gotten the role of Gilbert Blythe."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucas-jade-zumann-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>After landing his Anne with an E role, Zumann went on to star in the show for three seasons.</p><h2 id=what-has-lucas-jade-zumann-been-up-to-since-anne-with-an-e>What Has Lucas Jade Zumann Been Up To Since Anne With An E?</h2><p>When Anne with an E ended in 2019, the show's devoted fans were very disappointed to learn the series wasn't going to return. In fact, there are still people calling for Anne with an E to come back on social media to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 TV Shows That Were Canceled...And Then Brought Back</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for anyone who is holding out hopes that Anne with an E may return someday, that seems unlikely. That said, any Anne with an E fans who want to see more of Lucas Jade Zumann aren't completely out of luck.</p><p>Since the last episode of Anne with an E aired, two acclaimed movies that starred Zumann have been released to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Technically speaking, To the Stars had its movie premiere before Anne with an E ended since it was screened at Sundance in January 2019. However, the movie got its wide release in April 2020 and that was the first time most movie film fans could see it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucas-jade-zumann-and-kara-hayward-in-to-the-stars.jpg><p>On Rotten Tomatoes, To the Stars has an 82% rating as of this writing and it has an interesting critical consensus. "Its reach may occasionally exceed its grasp, but To the Stars uses its period setting as an effective backdrop for an insightful look at female friendship."</p><p>In 2021, a movie with the fantastic title Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets was released with Zumann in the starring role. As of the time of this writing, Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for any fans who love seeing Zumann's acting, those two films are the only things he has appeared in since Anne with an E ended. On top of that, Zumann doesn't have any upcoming projects that have been listed on IMDb either.</p><p>While Zumann doesn't appear to be focused on his acting career as of this moment, that definitely doesn't mean that he isn't busy. As evidenced by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zumann's Instagram posts</a>, the former Anne with an E star actually has a lot going on these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Are Also Licensed Pilots</a></span></p><p>First off, Zumann has several posts on Instagram that reveal that he has been learning to fly planes. In fact, Zumann is far enough along in the process that he has posted about getting his</p><p>Private Pilot certificate and having passengers for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Zumann appears to have put acting on the back burner, that certainly doesn't mean that he hasn't been expressing himself artistically. On Zumann's Instagram page, there are several videos of him playing guitar by himself and performing with friends.</p><p>Finally, it seems very clear that Zumann is dedicated to becoming a well-rounded person. After all, a recent video Zumann posted shows he has gotten himself in amazing shape, and he has been learning to work with his hands as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brjUnJisZZqWsaZ52a6kmqaeYq6nwMSrZJqmnpp6uLXToWSapl2afA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jasmine-lejeune-girlfriend-of-elijah-mitchell-his-parents-family-salary-jersey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jasmine LeJeune, Girlfriend of Elijah Mitchell?
