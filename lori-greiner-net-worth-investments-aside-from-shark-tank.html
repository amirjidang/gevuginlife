This led to her having her own show, Clever & Unique Creations, in 2000, which then led to <a href=#>Greiner replacing Barbara Corcoran as one of the judges on ABC's Shark Tank in 2012.</a> According to Parade, she's making $50,000 per episode on the show, which works out to be $1.2 million per season (22 episodes).

Scrub Daddy raked in over $200 million in retail sales from 2014 to 2023, and Greiner's 20% equity stake in the company gives her a $9 million return from the profits.

The show became an excellent platform to market her products, and by 2010, her brand pulled in an estimated $350 million in sales. Using the success of her company brand as an example, Greiner has also been a mentor to entrepreneurs, has been featured in publications such as Forbes, Financial Times, Success, and Entrepreneur to name a few.
