The 50-year-old actress appeared comfortable in a luxurious white bathrobe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Costner Bans Ex-Wife From Taking Furniture, Decor, & Appliances When Moving Out</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Exclusive photos from Page Six</a> captured her carrying a toiletry case and a water bottle as she headed to the basic restroom at 6 a.m. on Thursday.</p><p>It’s been reported that Tori has been living on the campground with her six kids <a href=#>following a brief stint in a nearby motel in July,</a> which she claimed was due to mold in their rental house.</p><p>“Here we are again at Urgent Care. We’ve all been on this continual spiral of sickness for months. Sick. Get better. To get sick again,” she said in an Instagram post, explaining the mold put her family in the hospital.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Used to think… well that’s what happens when you have young kids in school. They just continually bring sicknesses home,” she continued. “But, when it gets to the point where they are at home sick more than being in school we had to reassess what was going on.”</p><p>The actress is currently going through a separation from estranged husband Dean McDermott. He hasn’t been spotted on the trip.</p><p>Dean originally announced they were separating after nearly two decades of marriage in June, and though he deleted the Instagram post shortly after, sources say he’s still pursing the divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Dean] 100 percent wants to get out of the marriage. He took down the post because Tori didn’t want him to keep it up. But he’s packing his bags and is 100 percent serious about it,” <a href=#>a source told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>The insider said the only reason Dean hadn’t moved out yet was because he couldn’t “afford” a second residence, though the estranged couple appear to be living separately now.</p><p>Dean and Tori <a href=#>have a long history of financial problems,</a> which they’ve admitted has taken a toll on their marriage over the years. It’s been speculated this is fuelling their current separation.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West Is Working On A New Album, Which Could Save His Dwindling Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>SheKnows</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmatp6KeerS8xKWjoqaXYra0ecKuqaudnqm5unnLoq2ippditq95wGarq5mZobKzec%2BaqaRlp57BqXnHnqlmq5mteqy1w2aYpqGUYrGqws6rmp5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./unmasking-the-mystery-who-is-famous-dexs-secret-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Unmasking the Mystery: Who is Famous Dexs Secret Girlfriend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-worst-ever-renditions-of-the-u-s-national-anthem.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Worst Ever Renditions of the U.S. National Anthem</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
