Let's take a look at her career and what she has been up to since her split from Dylan.</p><p><strong>Updated on December 17, 2021, by Michael Chaar</strong>: Dyland O'Brien and Britt Robertson dated for a whopping six years before officially calling it quits in 2018. The duo met in 2012 working on the set of The First Time, dating shortly after. Following their break up, Britt was romantically linked to Riverdale star, KJ Apa, however, the two broke things off in 2019. After spending Christmas with fellow actor, Graham Rogers, fans speculated if Britt and Rogers were a couple, however, the two are just friends. In the meantime, Britt Robertson has landed an array of film and TV roles including her time in Scream 4, Tomorrowland, and Life Unexpected, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britt-robertson-39-s-acting-roles>Britt Robertson's Acting Roles</h2><p>While <a href=#>KJ Apa's girlfriend is pregnant</a>, the Riverdale star was once romantically linked to Britt Robertson, according to Elle.com.</p><p>While Britt Robertson is a familiar name to movie fans, she has never headlined a major Hollywood blockbuster or starred on a TV show that went on for more than one season. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britt talked about her acting jobs with Buzzfeed News </a>and the actress said, "I've had such a weird career. I've kind of done little bits of everything."</p><p>Britt Robertson explained to Buzzfeed News that some of her roles weren't all that meaty, and that in other cases, she was so tired from filming that she might not have done the best acting job that she would now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britt took on the starring role of Cassie Blake in the CW drama The Secret Circle, which aired for one season in 2011. Cassie found out that she was a witch when she relocated to a town called Chance Harbor, and she became part of a coven. While that sounds like a thrilling and fascinating premise for a TV show, it was canceled after only one season.</p><p>Britt talked about it with Buzzfeed News and said, "It's a similar thing with Scream 4; I wish I would have made something out of nothing." She said the filming was "exhausting" and explained, "there were so many days where I would just be exhausted and not feeling like I had enough in me or, like, OK, well, I don't know what to do with this, so I'm going to do nothing with it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About her small role in Scream 4 in the opening sequence, Britt said, "I loved the Scream movies, and it's the only reason I did it. I was like, OK, there's no character here. I have no idea what I'm saying. This makes no sense. I don't know what to do. And I don't necessarily regret that experience. I just wish I would have taken advantage of it more."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Want A Movie With Logan Lerman And Dylan O'Brien After They Were Spotted Together</a></span></p><h2 id=britt-appeared-in-39-tomorrowland-39-and-39-ask-me-anything-39>Britt Appeared In 'Tomorrowland' And 'Ask Me Anything'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britt Robertson starred as Casey Newton in the 2015 movie Tomorowland, and according to Page Six, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britt didn't promote her movie Ask Me Anything</a>. Allison Burnett, the director of Ask Me Anything, said that Britt loved being in the movie and said it was an amazing experience: “when the movie was finished, she wrote to me and said she’d never been more proud of anything in her career and she’d do anything to help promote it.”</p><p>The director said that perhaps Disney didn't want Britt to do any promotion for a movie that was considered "racy" and was much different from Tomorrowland.</p><p>The director continued that once the movie's release approached, “Britt’s reps didn’t answer calls or e-mails. She’s gone AWOL and won’t return e-mails from me or the producers.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Demands Dylan O'Brien Start TikTok Account After He Dances To Doja Cat</a></span></p><h2 id=britt-robertson-39-s-many-tv-roles>Britt Robertson's Many TV Roles</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of Britt Roberton's other roles include Angie McAlister in the TV adaptation of Stephen King's novel Under The Dome, which only got one season, and Lux Cassidy on the single-season TV show Life Unexpected.</p><p>If these shows had lasted for longer, then maybe Britt would be a bit of a bigger name, but she did show her acting talents in each one.</p><p>On Life Unexpected, Lux finds her birth parents, Cate and Nate. She wants to leave the foster care system and get emancipated and they end up taking care of her. It's just as heartwarming as it sounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with PopSugar, Britt talkeda bout how much she loves the characters on the show. Britt said, "One of the great things about the show is that our characters are really real, and they're different and they're put in these extraordinary circumstances. It's really cool; it's a really great show you want to sort of dive into, and really feel for these characters. You want them to explore all these relationships and explore all these emotions, and you want to go on this ride with them, and I think that's the great appeal for our show."</p><p>While Britt Robertson might not necessarily be a household name, she has been acting a lot over the years, and according to IMDb, she just finished the movie A Mouthful Of Air and is currently filming The Re-Education Of Molly Singer, so fans will see more from her.</p><h2 id=who-is-britt-robertson-dating-now>Who Is Britt Robertson Dating Now?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While KJ Apa is the last high-profile actor Britt Robertson was romantically linked to, there have been a few rumors regarding a possible romance with fellow Atypical actor, Graham Rogers.
