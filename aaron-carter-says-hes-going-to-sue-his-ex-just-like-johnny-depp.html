Not only was he <a href=#>awarded $10 million in damages</a>, but the public court case boded well for his reputation, breathing new life into his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears other celebrities are looking to Johnny for inspiration, including Aaron Carter, who recently said he’s taking his ex to court.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian & Scott Disick Sued For $40 Million Over Instagram Scam</a></span></p><p>On Sunday, the paparazzi caught up with the former reality star, where Aaron opened up about the situation with his ex Melanie Martin, whom he shares a 9-month-old son with.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, he’s thinking of suing her for defamation after she claimed he broke her ribs earlier this year, which he says is untrue. Aaron said he believes the case will be very similar to Johnny and Amber’s legal issues. He even pleaded to one of Johnny’s attorneys, Camille Vasquez, to represent him.</p><p>The singer didn’t mention how much money, if any, he hopes to win from a lawsuit.</p><p>Aaron and Melanie welcomed their son, Prince, in November 2021 after she delivered via emergency c-section.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Emergency C Section after 13 hours of labor but my fiancé is in great health thank you lord and the incredibly sweet loving staff here,” Aaron wrote on Instagram at the time. “Prince is precious I love you son. Your mommy loves you as I drop tears on the phone.”</p><p>The couple had previously gotten engaged in March 2020, but they broke up only a week after their son’s birth. Aaron went online to <a href=#>claim he was “deceived”</a> and Melanie had been “lying to me the whole time.”</p><p>Aaron and Melanie have been on-and-off since welcoming their son. Though they’re not currently together, they got into an altercation as recently as last Thursday, when she showed up at his house accusing him of stealing her things. Aaron claims police escorted him off his property. Their son was not present at the time of the incident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it was reported earlier this month that both parents had lost custody of their son amid domestic abuse and drug concerns. The child is currently being cared for by Melanie’s mother.</p><p>Aaron has since entered a voluntary drug treatment program. "<a href=#>This will by my fifth time in rehabilitation</a>," he’s said. "I haven't had any relapses it's just triggers are big right now for me. I want my son back."</p><p>The parents are due to appear in court later this month to discuss custody.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye Is Launching A New Brand, Also Expanding Donda Sports</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Yahoo!
