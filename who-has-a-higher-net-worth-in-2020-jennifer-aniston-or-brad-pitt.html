The moment she was cast to play the role of Rachel Green, everyone suddenly knew who Aniston was. More importantly, her performance earned her five Emmy nominations and one Emmy win. Meanwhile, the success of the show also meant that Aniston and her co-stars got paid more and more each season. Towards the end of the show’s run, the Friends cast even received a hefty $1 million per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Paul Rudd Almost Ran Jennifer Aniston Over</a></span></p><p>Aside from being paid lots of money for Friends, Aniston also managed to secure a lot of endorsement deals.
