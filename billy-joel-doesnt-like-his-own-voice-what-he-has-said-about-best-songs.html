That wasn't always the case with Billy Joel, however.</p><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern interviewed Billy Joel</a> for a SiriusXM Town Hall, and he talked about his voice. According to Consequence.net, he said, "I like [my voice] better now than I used to. I don’t think of myself as a singer."</p><p>This might be surprising for fans to hear since Joel has been releasing songs and performing since the 1970s. It also seems like smoking might have affected his voice over the years. Joel said in the same interview, “It’s terrible for your voice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-joel-wrote-quot-piano-man-quot-about-a-job-he-once-had><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Billy Joel Wrote "Piano Man" About A Job He Once Had</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/billy-joel-smiling-as-he-plays-piano.jpg><p>Billy Joel's 1973 song "Piano Man" was his first massive hit, and fans still love it to this day. It tells a great story about a musician who plays the piano at a restaurant and comes across many different people.

He explained, "It’s pretty accurate. It’s what really went on when I was a piano man in this piano bar. All the characters have the same name: there was John at the bar, the bartender; Davy was in the Navy; a guy named Paul, who was a real estate agent and was trying to write the great American novel, and the waitress, who was my girlfriend at the time and then became my wife."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-joel-39-s-quot-new-york-state-of-mind-quot-was-meant-to-be-positive><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Billy Joel's "New York State Of Mind" Was Meant To Be Positive</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/billy-joel.jpg><p>The Billy Joel song "New York State Of Mind" was on his album "Turnstiles," which was released in 1976. The lyrics of the chorus are memorable: "It comes down to reality/And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide/Don't care if it's Chinatown or up on Riverside/I don't have any reasons/I've left them all behind/I'm in a New York state of mind." Joel also sang the song with Tony Bennett.</p><p>In a 2015 interview with Newsday, Joel explained why he wrote the tune. He said, “A lot of bad things were happening in New York then. There was a lot of crime. Drugs were out of control. The city looked bad; it was really dirty. It almost defaulted, financially. It really needed a boost, and I wanted to write an anthem for it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-joel-wrote-quot-uptown-girls-quot-when-he-dated-christie-brinkley><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Billy Joel Wrote "Uptown Girls" When He Dated Christie Brinkley</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/billy-joel-1.jpg><p>Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel were married from 1985 to 1994, and he wrote at least one song about her.

But, in fact, he wrote it because he was dating Christie Brinkley. As Joel told Howard Stern, “So I’m dating Elle for a couple of months, on and off. She went to Europe, and I figured that was it. Then I started to date Christie, after Elle and I had stopped dating. Rather than the song being about all these different girls, she became the uptown girl. I started writing it about one person. They got the story wrong.

When compared to the singer's other popular songs, it's definitely a bit racier. He sang about someone who wanted to sleep with a religious girl.</p><p>Recently, Joel said that he realized that the song has some issues. He told The Los Angeles Times, "It’s kind of a selfish song — like, who cares what happens to you? What about what I want? But on the other hand, it was of its time.

It's a beautiful tune, and he was actually thinking about another musician he wrote it. The lyrics are very romantic, especially "Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own/But that's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home" and "Well, I'll never be a stranger and I'll never be alone/Wherever we're together, that's my home."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While of course many bands and singers have released countless songs about love, there is something else that fans should know about this song.
