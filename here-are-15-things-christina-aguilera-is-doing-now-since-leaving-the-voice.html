The tiny blonde from Staten Island, New York wasn’t your average pop star. She had a voice that blew most other artists out of the water. Christina had chart-topping hits such as “Genie in a Bottle,” “What a Girl Wants,” and “Beautiful”; she even sang “Reflection” for Disney’s Mulan. However, after the album Back to Basics in 2006, Christina couldn’t really maintain her popularity, and other talented stars started to gain more attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Aguilera came back to the spotlight as a judge on The Voice, a show about training singers. Through the show, Christina became more prevalent, attending more red carpets and being in the news again. However, she did leave the show in 2016, calling it a ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">churning hamster wheel</a>.’</p><p>So, what has Christina been up to since then? Let’s take a look!</p><h2 id=being-engaged><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Being Engaged!</span></h2><p>Christina and Matthew Rutler started dating after they met on the set of Burlesque in 2010, and they were engaged on February 14, 2014. The two are still engaged, currently, so Christina has obviously been enjoying her time as a fiancée and planning her wedding (which will surely be beautiful).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone Is Engaged!</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-houston-tribute><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Whitney Houston Tribute</span></h2><p>At the 2017 American Music Awards, Christina Aguilera performed a tribute to Whitney Houston—singing a medley of “I Will Always Love You,” “I Have Nothing,” “Run To You,” and “I’m Every Woman.” Her performance got mixed reviews, as some absolutely loved it while others found it to be underwhelming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=liberation><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Liberation!</span></h2><p>Christina Aguilera released her eighth album, Liberation, in June of 2018. It didn’t get a great deal of attention, but it garnered excellent reviews from fans and professional critics, alike. This was her first album in six years—which was quite a while—but the extra time obviously paid off!</p><h2 id=vegas-baby><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Vegas, Baby!</span></h2><p>Christina started a Las Vegas residency. Her first run of concerts, The Xperience, is dated from May 31, 2019 to March 7, 2020, and it features 90-plus minutes of shimmery costumes and powerful music numbers. Christina encourages audience members to let loose during the show and be their true selves.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani Isn't Returning To Season 18 Of 'The Voice' For Vegas Residence</a></span></p><h2 id=mommy-dearest><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Mommy Dearest</span></h2><p>Christina has two children: Max Liron, age 12, and Summer Rain, age six. Her son is from her first marriage to Jordan Bratman and her daughter is by current fiancé, Matt Rutler. Christina always puts her kids first. She’s even postponed tours to be the best mommy she can be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denied><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Denied!</span></h2><p>One night in New Orleans, Christina went out to Café Negril with her dancers. After two hours of dancing, Christina asked to sing with the band; but the singer, Claude Bryant, refused. Claude didn’t realize it was her! After the fact, he invited Christina to come back for a redo.</p><h2 id=makeunder><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>MakeUNDER</span></h2><p>In 2018, Christina Aguilera was on the cover for Paper magazine. She looked gorgeous without a stitch of makeup and reflected on her childhood, rise to fame, and love of music. Christina’s gone bare before (i.e., the music video for “The Voice Within”); however, the toned-down look is always welcome.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Kim Kardashian With No Makeup On</a></span></p><h2 id=x-tour><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>X Tour</span></h2><p>Christina’s X Tour ran from July to December 2019 and supported her album, Liberation. It was her sixth concert tour and she surely didn’t disappoint! Christina dressed in a myriad of colorful, attention-grabbing outfits and sang a medley of songs ranging from early 2000s hits to her more recent singles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mulan-remake><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mulan Remake</span></h2><p>Christina Aguilera’s rendition of “Reflection” from Disney’s 1998 film, Mulan, was her first-ever single—made when she was 17 years old. From that song, people instantly knew that Christina was, undeniably, a natural talent with a powerful voice. Now, Christina is set to sing “Reflection” for the live-action Mulan remake.</p><h2 id=kobe-memorial><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kobe Memorial</span></h2><p>In February 2020, Christina Aguilera gave an emotional performance to honor the deceased basketball legend, Kobe Byrant. On the Staples Center stage in Los Angeles, Christina used her powerhouse of a voice to sing “Ave Maria” in Italian with an orchestra accompanying her. The show was a heartbreakingly beautiful one.</p><h2 id=new-fanship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>New Fanship</span></h2><p>Christina and Demi Lovato paired up for the 2018 Billboard Music Awards to sing “Fall in Line” from Christina’s Liberation album. Demi has been a longtime fan of Christina’s and was excited to collaborate with the superstar. The two have also posted pictures on Instagram and seem to be friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carpool-karaoke><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Carpool Karaoke</span></h2><p>In 2018, Christina Aguilera went on&nbsp;The Late Late Show with James Corden and did the segment, Carpool Karaoke—where James drove Christina around while she belted out some of her most popular songs from the passenger seat. Melissa McCarthy even dropped into the backseat and rapped to Redman.</p><h2 id=rupaul-s-drag-race><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>RuPaul's Drag Race</span></h2><p>Christina caused much excitement being a guest judge on season 10 of RuPaul’s Drag Race in March 2018. The singer donned a pink wig with a semi-nude dress, looking fabulous in true drag fashion. Lady Gaga was a guest judge for season 9, so Christina was definitely in great company.</p><h2 id=accelerate-decelerated><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>"Accelerate" Decelerated</span></h2><p>Plenty of fans and critics, alike, were confused by Christina’s song, “Accelerate.” Being a single from her newest album, Liberation, people expected a bigger crash onto the scene. Apparently, Christina’s voice was virtually buried by the rappers on the song and it didn’t really gain much traction, attention, or likability.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-year-anniversary><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>20-Year Anniversary</span></h2><p>August 24, 2019 marked 20 years since Christina’s self-titled debut album hit stores. This was the album that launched Christina into the spotlight and made her into a household name. Christina celebrated the 20-year mark by posting a picture to Instagram, showing her in front of a bunch of balloons.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Cameron Diaz Has Been Up To Since Retiring From Acting</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVYq6zsYxqbGasmJ67qL%2BMnJ%2BroaOptq%2BtjJqerqGcmr%2BiecisZJ2nmaO0brrOsGSsoZ6Ysm64xJqtoqaXYsGpsYyvpqKblWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-marty-misty-matt-raney-make-on-homestead-rescue-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much The Raneys Really Get Paid For Homestead Rescue And What They Do With Their Incredible Fort</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-styles-and-taylor-russell-hold-hands-in-new-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Styles and Taylor Russell Hold Hands in New Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
