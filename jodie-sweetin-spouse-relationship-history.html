A sweet sitcom that could be enjoyed by people of all ages, millions of families tuned in to watch each new episode of Full House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there were many keys to Full House's success, one of the biggest was the show's cast. On one occasion <a href=#>Bob Saget remarked that Full House Bob Saget tainted him</a> but the show's fans always were loyal enough that they followed <a href=#>what happened to the sitcom's stars</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Rules The Cast Of Full (And Fuller) House Had To Follow</a></span></p><p>When Fuller House was announced and aired on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, it allowed fans of the original series to reconnect with almost all the stars they adored so much. As a result, when Fuller House's finale premiered in 2020, that could have marked the end of an era.</p><p>Fortunately for Full House's stars and fans, it seems pretty clear that their bond will never go away. As a result, fans continue to have a lot of interest in Jodie Sweetin's happiness and many of them want to know who the men she has married are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-jodie-sweetin-39-s-three-ex-husbands>Who Are Jodie Sweetin's Three Ex-Husbands?</h2><p>Before Jodie Sweetin walked down the aisle most recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she married three other men</a>. The same year Sweetin turned twenty years old, she tied the knot for the first time when she wed a Los Angeles police officer named Shaun Holguin in 2002.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Little-Known Facts About Jodie Sweetinâ€™s Family Life</a></span></p><p>When Sweetin got married for the first time, her longtime costar Candace Cameron Bure got the honor of standing beside her. Unfortunately, Sweetin and Shaun Holguin's marriage ended in 2006 and she has been open that their relationship was affected by her substance issues.</p><p>The year after Sweetin's first marriage ended, Jodie Sweetin met film transportation coordinator Cody Herpin and they started dating in May. Evidently smitten with each other, Sweetin and Herpin were wed in July of the same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Sweetin and Herpin's marriage, the couple had a daughter they named Zoie. Sadly, Sweetin has been open that after getting clean during her pregnancy, she relapsed a couple of months after her daughter was born.</p><p>Ultimately, Sweetin and Herpin couldn't make their marriage work and they finalized their divorce in 2010. As a part of that agreement, Sweetin agreed to pay Herpin child support monthly.</p><p>Before Sweetin's second marriage officially ended, she began dating a DJ and actor named Morty Coyle in 2009. Roughly a year into their relationship, Sweetin and Coyle welcomed Jodie's second daughter into the world and named the child Beatrix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years after their daughter was born, Sweetin and Coyle got engaged in 2011, and then they were wed in 2012. Only a year after Sweetin and Coyle got married, Jodie filed for separation.</p><p>Even though Sweetin and Coyle's relationship ended in 2013, it took until 2016 for them to finalize their divorce. Once Sweetin and Coyle were able to iron everything out, the couple agreed to share legal and physical custody of their daughter.</p><p>As a part of their divorce settlement, Sweetin and Coyle also agreed to split all money they made during their marriage. As a result, that meant that Coyle got a portion of Sweetin's Fuller House earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-jodie-sweetin-39-s-husband-mescal-wasilewski>Who Is Jodie Sweetin's Husband Mescal Wasilewski?</h2><p>If most people were given the choice between going through all the struggles Jodie Sweetin has experienced in her life or not, they would pass in a second. Despite that, at this point, it is crystal clear that Sweetin has learned a lot from her experiences.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Fuller House' Star Jodie Sweetin Helped This Massively Famous Actor Get Sober</a></span></p><p>In the past, Sweetin proved that she can use what she has learned to help others when she played a major role in John Stamos getting sober. Hopefully, Sweetin similarly has used the lessons she learned from her past divorces when she chose the man she is married to now.</p><p>On July 30th of 2022, Sweetin walked down the aisle with her current husband Mescal Wasilewski. By the time Sweetin and Wasilewski tied the knot, the pair knew each other very well as they'd already been dating for five years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, Sweetin spoke to People about Wasilewski. During that conversation, Sweetin praised the man who is now her husband and their relationship.</p><p>"We intertwine so well. He's funny and smart, and he's my biggest supporter. It's really magical."</p><p>On top of being Sweetin's husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasilewski has led a fascinating life</a>. Born in England, Wasilewski moved to Santa Monica, California when he was only eight years old.</p><p>Unfortunately for Wasilewski, he has battled addiction issues just like Jodie Sweetin. On the bright side, Wasilewski has been clean, sober, and smoke-free for more than twenty years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of turning his own life around, Wasilewski now works to help others. Employed as an addiction therapist, Wasilewski works at Catalyst Recovery.</p><p>As it turns out, early on in Sweetin and Wasilewski's relationship, they were a long-distance couple. Considering their relationship survived that, hopefully, their love will stay strong throughout the rest of their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJyZmnq0w8Seq6KmXai9sMHSnmSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdnba0wM6rsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-harts-friend-charged-in-sex-tape-extortion-scandal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Harts Friend Charged in Sex Tape Extortion Scandal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeanette-macdonald-cause-of-death-how-did-jeanette-macdonald-die-496421-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeanette MacDonald Cause of Death, How did Jeanette MacDonald Die?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
