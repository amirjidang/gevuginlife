The actress began her career at the young age of 11 and has since appeared in countless films and television shows, including Heroes, Nashville, and Ice Princess, to name a few. Despite having a successful professional career, Hayden has had quite a tumultuous personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she prefers to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep her private life out of the spotlight</a>, her last two relationships have both made major headlines. In February 2020, Hayden's boyfriend, Brian Hickerson, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for domestic abuse</a>, shocking just about everyone. Although this was quite a serious incident, it's not the only thing Hayden has been through when it comes to her love life.</p><p>Moving on from Hickerson, her marriage to boxer Wladimir Klitschko came about in 2009, and again in 2013. The duo welcomed their first child into the world in 2014. Although things were going well, Hayden and Wladimir split up, leading him and their daughter, Kaya, to permanently move to Ukraine. The details surrounding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their split have recently come to light</a>, leaving many to wonder what exactly happened between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on July 19, 2022:</strong> Hayden Panettiere has recently shared more information on why she and Wladimir Klitschko inevitably split. Last month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayden spoke to People</a>, saying that while she was suffering from postpartum depression, she had also turned to substances. To cope with the darkness she was feeling, she would ingest alcohol and opioids in hopes that the depression would go away. She has since gone to rehab and sought therapy, leading her to her current state of sobriety.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All Of Hayden Panettiere's Movies And TV Shows, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-hayden-amp-her-ex>What Happened Between Hayden & Her Ex?</h2><p>Hayden Panettiere made headline news when it was revealed that she and former hubby, Wladimir Klitschko officially split up after their decade-long romance. The duo first began dating back in 2009, however they took a break before rekindling their flame in 2013. It was at this time that the couple not only became engaged but were expecting their first child together, a baby girl. After the birth of Kaya Klitschko, things began to go downhill with Hayden's mental health, ultimately leading to their split and a custody decision that took a toll on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Kaya's birth in December 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Panettiere revealed she began to suffer</a> from postpartum depression, admitting that it was very "Scary and needs to be talked about. It's something a lot of women experience." Hayden made it clear that things never took a turn for the worse when it came to the safety and well-being of their daughter. Due to Hayden's condition, she found herself checking into a rehabilitation center in October 2015, just 10 months after Kaya's birth. While her efforts paid off, Hayden went back to rehab in May 2016 for a second time, proving just how serious her situation was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Keep Their Kids Hidden From The Public</a></span></p><h2 id=panettiere-39-s-decision-to-seek-help-for-her-mental-state>Panettiere's Decision To Seek Help For Her Mental State</h2><p>Although the couple remained together during Hayden's struggles through postpartum depression, things became too heavy for the actress, so heavy in fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she voluntarily gave up custody of her then 2-year-old.</a> This was by no means a decision forced onto her by Wladimir, who she remains friendly with to this very day. In 2018, the couple officially split up for good.</p><p>Considering Wladimir is a professional Ukrainian boxer and lives now in his home country of Ukraine with Kaya. Luckily for Hayden, her life returned to normal when she went back to work on Nashville, allowing her to focus on her professional life and fly back and forth from LA to Kyiv any chance she gets. Although there has been no talk regarding her regaining custody, we are certain that the trio will one day become a family again!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>She's Back!
