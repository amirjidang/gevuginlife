And judging from the performance of countries that take these pageants the most seriously, effort seems to translate into results. Yes, in general, nations that have the most sophisticated preparations for their&nbsp;prospective candidates -- including beauty pageant schools, grueling fitness regimens, and even radical cosmetic surgery -- win the most often. But what's the big deal with beauty pageants in the first place?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, there's a lot at stake. Aside from elevating a country's&nbsp;national pride, international beauty queens&nbsp;can become instant celebrities with assured bright futures ahead of them, most especially if the international crown brought home is among the most prestigious ones. Currently, Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss International, and Miss Earth are the pageants&nbsp;most widely&nbsp;accepted&nbsp;to be among "The Big Four" -- the pinnacles of international beauty pageant achievement.</p><p>Here are the eleven countries, which have so far managed to collect the highest number of titles from the most prestigious and most prominent international beauty pageants:</p><h2 id=t10-colombia-5-titles><strong>T10. Colombia (5 Titles)</strong></h2><p>Via wallpapershome.com</p><p><strong>Title Winners:</strong> Luz Marina Zuluaga (1958 Ms. Universe), Stella Márquez (1960 Ms. International),&nbsp;Paulina Gálvez (1999 Ms. International),&nbsp;Jeymmy Vargas (2004 Ms. International),&nbsp;Paulina Vega (2014 Ms. Universe)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Colombia has won five Big Four titles, including the most recent edition of the Miss Universe pageant. The victory&nbsp;by Paulina Vega in 2014 was considered an important one in Colombia, as it was the first in a decade, and the country is known to take its beauty pageants very seriously. In fact, local Colombian pageants have been&nbsp;described as being&nbsp;cut-throat. The approach seems to be effective, however, as apart from the five crowns Colombia has won, it has also amassed twenty-one runner-up finishes.</p><p></p><h2 id=t10-germany-5-titles><strong>T10. Germany (5 Titles)</strong></h2><p>Via parkerlebnis.de</p><p><strong>Title Winners:&nbsp;</strong>Petra Schürmann (Ms. World 1956),&nbsp;Marlene Schmidt (Ms. Universe 1961), Ingrid Finger (Ms. International 1965), Gabriella Brum (Ms. World 1980), Iris Klein (Ms. International 1989)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Germany claimed its first major international title during the&nbsp;1956 Miss World pageant, and 24&nbsp;years later, Germany won Miss World again. However, Gabriella Brum gave up the title just 17 hours after winning it.&nbsp;The media reported that Brum's boyfriend, Hollywood cameraman Benno Bellenbaum, had spoken about being&nbsp;unhappy with Brum's victory since it meant being separated from his girlfriend. Furthermore, Bellenbaum revealed to reporters that he had taken nude photographs of Brum.</p><p></p><h2 id=t8-brazil-6-titles><strong>T8.

The "grand slam" of international beauty pageants was completed&nbsp;in 2004, when Priscilla Meirelles was named "Miss Earth," the three other titles having previously been won by Brazilian contestants in past years. In fact, the set could have been completed earlier, but Miss Brazil only managed 1st Runner-up finishes in the 2000 and 2003 editions of Miss Earth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=t8-sweden-6-titles><strong>T8.

On&nbsp;July 29, 1951, a&nbsp;24-year-old&nbsp;Kicki Håkansson took home the&nbsp;first ever Miss World crown. In fact, Sweden won the title&nbsp;again the following year with May-Louise Flodin completing&nbsp;a rare back-to-back victory.&nbsp;Since then, Sweden has won another Miss World crown (1977) and two Miss Universe titles (1955, 1984). However, it has been thirty years since Sweden's last Big Four win.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-australia-7-titles><strong>7.

Nevertheless, Australia has achieved the Universe-World double, the achievement coming in 1972 when Kerry Anne Wells and Belinda Green won the Miss Universe and Miss World crowns, respectively. Hopefully, the country can soon end its&nbsp;third decade-long drought in terms of winning Big Four beauty pageants.</p><p></p><h2 id=t4-united-kingdom-england-8-titles><strong>T4.

However, the mention of the accomplishment&nbsp;often raises eyebrows as all of those victories took place when the pageant was held in London, leading some to suspect&nbsp;that the U.K. could have benefited from its&nbsp;"home court" advantage.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the U.K. has won three other Big Four titles, all of them awarded in Japan.</p><p></p><h2 id=t4-india-8-titles><strong>T4.

The&nbsp;country came ever so close to winning a Miss International crown four times -- 1960, 1997, 2003, and 2013 -- with the country's bet being named 1st Runner-up in those years. However, the country has made beauty pageant history by being&nbsp;the first nation&nbsp;to twice hold more than one of the&nbsp;Big Four titles simultaneously. India first achieved the feat in 1994, when Sushmita Sen and Aishwarya Rai won the Miss Universe and Miss World titles, respectively. The country then duplicated&nbsp;the achievement in 2000, when Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra were named Miss Universe and Miss World, respectively.</p><p></p><h2 id=t4-puerto-rico-8-titles><strong>T4.

It&nbsp;is also among the most successful countries in the Miss Universe pageant with five titles, the most recent one coming in 2006 when&nbsp;Zuleyka Rivera won the pageant&nbsp;held in the United States. The following year,&nbsp;the Miss Puerto Rico pageant was featured in the international news after allegations that a candidate's belongings were&nbsp;pepper sprayed, thus causing the contestant great discomfort during the competition. In the end, the victim, Ingrid Marie Rivera, still won the crown and represented Puerto Rico in the 2008 Miss Universe pageant.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-philippines-10-titles><strong>3.

U.S.A.&nbsp;also holds the lead in the number of Miss Universe winners a country has produced with 8, the first being Miriam Stevenson in 1954 and the last, Olivia Culpo in 2012. And perhaps it's only fitting that the United States does&nbsp;so well in international beauty pageants. After all, it's recognized as the birthplace of such competitions. In 1926,&nbsp;the International Pageant of Pulchritude, featuring candidates from various countries, was held in Galveston, Texas, and the event is said to have served as the model for the modern international pageant as we know it today.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-venezuela-21-titles><strong>1.

And rightfully so. With its 21 titles, the country is way ahead of all others and is, in fact, the only nation&nbsp;to have won all of the&nbsp;Big Four titles at least twice. This dominant performance is&nbsp;undoubtedly fueled by&nbsp;Venezuelans' unparalleled love for beauty pageants. Two thirds&nbsp;of the country's population have been reported to tune&nbsp;in to the final of the Ms. Venezuela beauty pageant, where the country's representatives to the&nbsp;Big Four&nbsp;are chosen. In fact, when the 2005 edition of the Ms. Venezuela broadcast was momentarily interrupted by a televised speech from the country's&nbsp;president, thousands of enraged viewers in Caracas banged on pots and shot guns into the air in protest.</p><p>However, those in charge of the Venezuelan beauty pageant scene have faced heavy criticism from the international press. In 2014, for example, the BBC aired Extreme Beauty Queens: Secrets of South America, wherein&nbsp;the country's shocking practices for preparing its beauty pageant contestants were revealed. These preparations&nbsp;included extensive cosmetic surgery and even sewing a plastic mesh onto the tongue to control eating behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>bbc.com</a>, <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>people.com</a>, <a href=#>independent.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWJ%2BcXnTqKdmqJWns7C%2BzKKloGWTpMKvwNGinKxlmaN6qrrTnqmnmaSevK%2Bty2aZnpmlqcZuvMCgnJqmpKh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-5-richest-vampires.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 5 Richest Vampires</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarrtaj-gill-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-548606-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarrtaj Gill Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
