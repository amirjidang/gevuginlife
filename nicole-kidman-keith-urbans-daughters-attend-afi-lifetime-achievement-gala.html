The actress wore a glittering gold Balenciaga gown while Urban, 56, looked dapper in a classic black tuxedo.</p><p>Sunday, 15, donned a floral strapless gown with Faith, 13, rocking a strapless coral dress.

And then right there is the love of my life, and the loves of my life. My daughters have never been anywhere publicly with me on a red carpet, tonight was their first night, so they’re here, Sunday and Faith.”</p><p>Kidman noted that her mom, Janelle, would be watching the event over livestream while she could feel her late father Tony’s presence “every day.”</p><p>“And then there’s all my nieces and nephews and my sissy and my beautiful aunt and her husband, who’s our family now … this is all because of you,” she continued. “And I love you so much. So there’s no place like home, as they say. You’re my home. And thank you for flying halfway across the world.”</p><p>Kidman, who also shares children Bella, 31, and Conor, 29, with ex-husband Tom Cruise, has been a fixture in Hollywood since she was a teen, starring in films including Dead Calm (1989), Billy Bathgate (1991), To Die For (1995), Moulin Rouge! (2001), and The Hours (2002), for which she won an Oscar.
