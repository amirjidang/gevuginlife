And since we spent all the money on the commercial spot, we actually—we didn’t spend any money on the actual commercial. But the idea is I want you to go to yeezy.com,” Kanye said in the commercial, which was a selfie-style video filmed in his car.</p><p>Kanye’s <a href=#>net worth is estimated to be $400 million</a>, though it’s unclear how the success of his Vultures album and Super Bowl ad have increased his personal fortune.
