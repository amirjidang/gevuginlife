As per a recent conversation with British GQ, she prepared a five-year career plan when she was 12 and gave it to her parents in a Presentation to persuade them to let her perform as an actress.</p><p>Sweeney claims that her path to achievement has been unusually difficult. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reminisced on having to leave her birthplace</a> to follow her acting career in LA in a talk with tmrw. "Nobody around me had really experienced anything like this," she explained, "I'm from Spokane, Washington.
