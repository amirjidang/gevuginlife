The timing coincided with the end of the relationship</strong>, and <a href=#>the name of the album, The Tortured Poets Department, can be interpreted as a dig at him</a>.</p><p>Joe Alwyn shared a few years ago that Paul Mescal, Andrew Scott, and him had a group chat which was called "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tortured Men Club"</a>, and fans instantly made the connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the track list has been revealed, the fandom has come up with even more theories about the meaning of the songs. Starting with the song "So Long, London". As it is public knowledge, Joe Alwyn is English, but even more relevant is that, on the album Lover, Taylor wrote a song called "London Boy" about him. There is also the theory that the track "Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?" could be a reference to the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Given the title of the record, it would make sense to have references to poets there. The play is about a marriage that's falling apart, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, whose own relationship was incredibly complicated. But here's where it gets interesting: the song "...Ready For It?", which she wrote when she was with Joe, has a specific line that talks about him being the "Burton to this Taylor".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-can-we-expect-from-the-new-album>What Else Can We Expect From The New Album?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-2022-mtv-video-music-awards.jpg><p>As much as fan theories try to predict what Taylor Swift will do next (and sometimes they are eerily accurate), the singer always has some unexpected trick up her sleeve that manages to leave everyone stunned.

One with Post Malone, and one with Florence + The Machine. As the release date gets closer, surely we'll get more hints about what the next masterpiece will be like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrCwus2emq2hnpx6tLvNoGStoaShsrR505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKedp2Kura7UpmSjp5Virq3D2Kdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-dourdan-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gary Dourdan Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-bett-rickards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Bett Rickards Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
