Sure, people still wonder if these shows are heavily produced and edited. There are questions if the <a href=#>survival reality show Alone is real</a> because even when a show is filmed in the woods instead of in a city or town, viewers are still skeptical. Discovery's Homestead Rescue definitely seems to be one of the most fascinating shows of its kind. Marty Raney gives people advice on becoming homesteaders along with his children Misty and Matt. And it seems fair to assume that they have made some good money over 10 seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans wonder <a href=#>who pays for the Homestead Rescue renovations</a>. And fans also want to know about the Raney's family's Homestead Rescue salary along with what kind of lifestyle they lead.</p><h2 id=what-is-matt-misty-and-marty-raney-39-s-salary-on-homestead-rescue>What Is Matt, Misty, And Marty Raney's Salary On Homestead Rescue?</h2><p>According to Distractify, Marty Raney has a net worth of $1 million. His Homestead Rescue salary hasn't been shared. But it might be somewhere in between the lowest and the highest-paid reality stars. There is quite a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">range of reality show salaries</a>, according to Moneywise.com.</p><p>While NeNe Leakes was said to be paid $2.85 million during season 12 of The<strong> </strong><a href=#>Real Housewives</a><strong> </strong>of Atlanta, <a href=#>90 Day Fiance</a> stars are said to make $1,000 for every episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/marty-raney-and-cast-homestead-rescue.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many believe that since Marty Raney has $1 million, that must mean that he makes a lot of money for Homestead Rescue. And that must be true considering the fact that the reality series has been on the air for 10 seasons.</p><p>Matt and Misty Raney's net worths don't appear to be known, as people have thrown out various figures online. They don't seem to have quite as much money as their dad, though. However, it's possible to assume that all three are being paid the same to appear on Homestead Rescue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marty-Raney.jpg><p>Even though Marty Raney has definitely done well from Homestead Rescue, he seems to really love what he does. And since he spends his time helping people learn to live off the land and have a simpler life, he doesn't appear to think much about money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he gives interviews, he talks about the joy he derives from meeting people and being there for them during the process of learning how to be a homesteader.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>TLC Has A History Of Making Shows That Are Equally Controversial As They Are Bizarre</a></span></p><p>In a 2017 interview with Hidden Remote, Marty shared that he loves making Homestead Rescue with his children. And it seems like it's really meaningful for him. Marty said it makes him uncomfortable to think about having "fans." It's sweet to hear him talk about how much he appreciates the people who watch the show and support him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homestead-rescue-marty-misty-matt-raney.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marty said, "I’m not a big fan of the word…fan. I never use it. Why? Because without those faithful viewers/supporters, this interview doesn’t exist and in this medium, neither do I. The first thing that I say now to everyone is thank you. Viewers will never know how hard we’ve worked to make a show that changes people’s lives and, for me, this has become the peak of privilege, not to mention sharing that privilege with Misty Mae and Matt."</p><p>Even though the Raney family must be paid well to appear on Homestead Rescue, it seems that they are still the same people they have always been. Ini and Wren appeared in an episode of Homestead Rescue and spoke to the Ozark County Times about what it was like.</p><p>They praised the Raney family, Marty in particular, for being kind. They also said that he's definitely someone who cares about the work that he's doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple said, "Marty is for sure an intense dude and very kind and caring. They all truly came to help and are big-hearted, hard-working, real people. What impressed me most about Marty was that often when the cameras weren’t rolling, he would be out there working, bare-chested and sweaty."</p><h2 id=how-do-the-raney-family-spend-their-money-from-homestead-rescue>How Do The Raney Family Spend Their Money From Homestead Rescue?</h2><p>When compared to other families who have starred on a reality TV show for many years, the Raneys definitely seem more frugal and humble. They don't live in massive, lavish mansions or buy new, fancy cars.</p><p>Homestead Rescue is about living off the land and having a different kind of existence. And that seems to be what the Raneys like to do in their free time when they aren't filming the reality series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Where-Marty-From-Homestead-Rescue-Gets-His-Money-And-Who-Really-Pays-For-The-Renovations.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Marty Raney spends his money on plans for a cabin. According to Distractify, he has been thinking about a "multi-generational cabin" for a long time, and he wants it to be located on a cliff. Since Marty has a net worth of $1 million, he doesn't have to worry about money and can create the cabin that he really wants.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Are The Cast Members Of TLC’s ‘Extreme Sisters’ Paid?</a></span></p><p>Judging from Marty's Instagram account, he doesn't seem to travel for fun. He mostly posts about Homestead Rescue. If he's going on a trip, it's because he's filming it for the show.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with Fox News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marty talked about traveling for Homestead Rescue</a> and how before he began appearing on the show, he stayed in Alaska.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homestead-rescue-misty-raney.jpg><p>Marty told Fox News that he believes in homesteading because it's all about hard work and putting in a lot of effort. He said, "The America that I'm seeing is rural; the America that I'm seeing is farmers, ranchers, homesteaders and those to choose to live off-the-grid and when you think about, it was that collective, that demographic, that built America, hands down, and they did it with hand tools."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Contestants On Alone Actually Get Paid?</a></span></p><p>Marty's daughter Misty Raney Bilodeau seems to travel a little more than her dad. Over the past few years, she has posted about "missing the beach." And while she does travel for Homestead Rescue, it's possible to guess that she spends more money on travel than her father does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homestead-rescue-misty-matt-marty-raney.jpg><p>According to TV Over Mind, Misty lives in both Alaska and Hawaii. Misty and her husband Maciah Bilodeau and son live in Hawaii during the wintertime. It's not known if Misty purchased a home in Hawaii, but if she did, it's possible to assume that she used money that she earned from Homestead Rescue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIymmKusqWK6qr%2FTsmSmmaSperOtzZ6wZqWRoLJuu81mn6illajBpq3DZqmeq5Oqsm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-danuel-house-still-married-to-wife-whitney-house-524576-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Danuel House Still Married to Wife Whitney House?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-are-15-things-christina-aguilera-is-doing-now-since-leaving-the-voice.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are 15 Things Christina Aguilera Is Doing Now (Since Leaving The Voice)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
