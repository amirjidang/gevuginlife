We are approaching 10 years of marriage and it is quite a struggle. It just so happened to be filmed where we are going through some tough things and having really vulnerable conversations. It was like every confessional was like a therapy session,” Monique told Us Weekly in May about their reality TV return. “I hope that in a sense as we look back on the show it will strengthen our marriage and our bond and take our communication to another level. You get to see these friendship circles navigate life and just doing our best to maintain our happiness and peace and uplift each other. But there is going to be a lot of drama and a lot of scandal.”</p><p>Monique added that the show was different than filming for Bravo.</p><p>“I feel like when I was on RHOP I got the ‘spoiled wife edit.’ It was almost like we can’t show her as a businesswoman. We can’t show her too much with her kids. It was like I was only supposed to be the big spender and it was like that’s not really me. I can do that at times, but that’s not the full person. I am a very hard-working individual and I’m not a kept wife,” she said. “It’s [now] nice that I am able to be me 100 percent. In the midst of it all I wasn’t encouraged to be one way or the other. It was just you be you and they’re going to tell the story based on what actually happened.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BlwG65zqegqq2VYsCiudSeo6xlmKrAo63NnWScoKKewG6%2FxJ6koqaXocZurcOdqZ6ro2LAsbjIrWSrnaCkv7V7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-tyson-wiki-bio-age-wife-daughter-net-worth-height-family-parents-nationality-ethnicity-and-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Tyson Wiki, Bio, Age, Wife, Daughter, Net Worth, Height, Family, Parents, Nationality, Ethni</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnant-sophie-turner-cradles-her-baby-bump-on-walk-with-joe-jonas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Sophie Turner Cradles Her Baby Bump on Walk With Joe Jonas</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
