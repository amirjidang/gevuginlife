While putting extreme focus and energy into the challenges and competitions on the show, they were also<a href=#> balancing their personal relationship</a> as well, and at times, that was kept very low-key and <a href=#>concealed from their fans. </a>This couple has truly journeyed through a lot together, and the latest adventure they have just embarked on in recent days, may very well be the wildest ride of their lives...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kam-williams-and-leroy-garrett-didn-39-t-hit-it-off-right-away><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kam Williams And Leroy Garrett Didn't Hit It Off Right Away</span></h2><p>It wasn't necessarily love at first sight for this couple. They didn't click perfectly right away, but it was tough to deny that there was definitely an attraction between them, on some level. Leroy played on MTV's The Challenge for several years before he met Kam, but when she joined 2018's The Vendettas, the two crossed paths. Interestingly, it wasn't until a full three seasons later, when they were in War Of The World II that fans noticed there was something happening between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>MTV 'The Challenge': The Feuds And Rivalries Fans Still Talk About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-first-entered-into-a-very-casual-relationship><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They First Entered Into A Very Casual Relationship</span></h2><p>In the beginning states of their relationship, things between Kam Williams and Leroy Garrett were pretty casual. It became apparent to fans that there was definitely some sort of chemistry between them, but it just as evident that this was far from being a committed relationship. The two enjoyed getting to know one another and seemed to be engaged in nothing more than a fling for quite some time.</p><h2 id=there-was-a-break-up-and-then-a-make-up><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>There Was A Break-up, And Then A Make-up</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans began really paying attention to the development of Kam and Leroy's relationship, and at some point, between the War of the Worlds in 2019 and Double Agents, the two sent off some serious on-again, off-again vibes. They both seemed to be on the same page in declaring that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> they weren't very serious with one another</a> and were just taking things as they come. Fans had no idea that their dynamics were about to change dramatically.</p><h2 id=deep-romance-regrets><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Deep Romance Regrets</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like in other relationships, there were some moments between Kam Williams and Leroy Garrett that were full of regrets. They both admitted that they broke things off between them to ensure that they could put their entire focus on competing on The Challenge. There was a time that they both agreed getting romantically involved had ruined their friendship. At one point, Leroy said, “The biggest regret I ever had was sleeping with Kam. She told me, ‘Leroy, us hooking up, it won’t be good for us. It will end bad.’ And I’m like, ‘No, let’s do it.’ … I never wanted to be disrespectful to Kam.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>MTV 'The Challenge': The Richest Cast Members Who Never Won A Final</a></span></p><h2 id=in-2020-things-got-serious-for-kam-williams-and-leroy-garrett><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In 2020, Things Got Serious For Kam Williams And Leroy Garrett</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the ambiguity in that phase of their relationship, Leroy and Kam seemed to find their way back to one another again, and Leroy went on to say that his best game was played in season 36, when he and Kam had formed a secret alliance. They made sure to play on different teams to avoid being targeted, and their coy move got them both all the way to the finals. They were clearly working together in more ways than one, as their personal life began to spark up again.</p><h2 id=they-started-a-new-chapter><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Started A New Chapter</span></h2><p>In February of 2020, Kam Williams stunned fans with an Instagram post that revealed some huge news. Her social media message announced that she and Leroy Garrett had decided to move in with one another. The two had signed a lease and were on their way to move to Houston. They both seemed to be very excited about embarking on the next chapter in their lives, with Kam quoted as saying, “I’m so excited to start this journey with you, especially since it’s something new for the both of us. I didn’t know my life would’ve changed like this when I met you 4 years ago & I’m happy that it did... to us and our new life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-both-hit-a-high-note-on-39-the-challenge-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Both Hit A High Note On 'The Challenge'</span></h2><p>One of the most interesting aspects of their relationship is the fact that in spite of intertwining a hugely competitive game on The Challenge and a complex dating relationship, both Kam Williams and Leroy Garrett managed to hit a high note on the reality TV show. The bond and alliance they formed got them each a Gold Skull, and they were able to both see success and recognition for all of their efforts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything 'The Challenge' OG Melinda Collins Has Done Since Her 'Real World' Season</a></span></p><h2 id=leroy-garrett-puts-his-focus-on-his-career-as-a-barber><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Leroy Garrett Puts His Focus On His Career As A Barber</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After 12 seasons of competing on the show, Leroy decided he was throwing in the towel and walked away from The Challenge. He took to Instagram to announce that he was retiring from the show and revealed to his fans that he was going to shift his focus to his career as a barber. Kam went on to publicly throw her support behind Leroy's decision and professed how incredibly happy she was to see him in pursuit of his dreams with such focus.</p><h2 id=kam-williams-39-s-future-on-39-the-challenge-39-remained-ambiguous><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kam Williams's Future On 'The Challenge' Remained Ambiguous</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leroy definitively left the show and made sure to cascade that news to his fans, while on the other hand, Kam's future on The Challenge remained uncertain. She didn't advise her followers about whether or not she planned on returning to the show, but she was notably absent from season 37, Spies, Lies, and Allies. She's a fierce competitor, and many fans hope for her return, however, she hasn't made a firm announcement on whether or not she'd consider a comeback.</p><h2 id=kam-and-leroy-are-having-a-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kam And Leroy Are Having A Baby!</span></h2><p>Kam Williams and Leroy Garret have just announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they are having a baby!</a> These soon-to-be parents are now officially a family, and it seems that neither of them could possibly be happier to embark on this incredibly exciting, very new chapter of their lives together.
