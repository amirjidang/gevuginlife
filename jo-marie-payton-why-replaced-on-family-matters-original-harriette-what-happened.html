For example, people constantly talk about shows like Friends, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Seinfeld to this day. Of course, given how popular all of those shows were and continue to be, it makes perfect sense that they get a lot of credit. However, there are lots of <a href=#>classic sitcoms that are arguably better than any comedy shows on television today</a> and some of them which aired during the ‘90s deserve more credit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for everyone involved in the production of the classic ‘90s sitcom Family Matters, the show doesn’t get talked about nearly enough today. Worse yet, some people think that <a href=#>Family Matters hasn’t aged well due to their perception of Steve Urkel in retrospect</a>. On top of that, some Family Matters fans have even come to believe that series star Jo Marie Payton hated working on the show which begs an obvious question, is that true?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Crappy 90s Sitcoms You Should Never Watch (No Matter How Bored You Are)</a></span></p><h2 id=the-rumored-feud-with-jaleel-white>The Rumored Feud With Jaleel White</h2><p>As anyone who follows the entertainment industry should know by now, there are a lot of actors in Hollywood who seem to have very delicate egos. Since so many stars seem to be very sensitive, it makes sense that there have been so many <a href=#>co-star feuds</a> over the years. After all, it is very clear that there are a lot of stars who simply can’t handle it when they feel like another actor is pushing them out of the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As longtime Family Matters fans may already know, the show was a spin-off based around the character Harriette Winslow that Jo Marie Payton first brought to life as a part of the sitcom Perfect Strangers. With that in mind, it certainly makes sense that Payton and her co-stars Reginald VelJohnson and Telma Hopkins assumed Family Matters would focus on their characters. Then, Jaleel White made his Family Matters debut several episodes into the first season and suddenly a lot of people thought the sitcom became the Steve Urkel show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 90s Sitcoms We'd Still Watch In 2020</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Family Matters began to primarily focus on Steve Urkel, there were rumors that Jo Marie Payton and some of her co-stars resented that fact. When he spoke to Entertainment Weekly in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaleel White stated that there was some reality to the rumors</a>. "I didn't see how I was stepping on anybody's toes, I was taking anybody's shine. It's very important that I say this: I was not very well welcomed to the cast at all, okay?"</p><p>In 2010, Jo Marie Payton talked to an interviewer for the website tvseriesfinale.com. During that interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Payton expressed her appreciation for Jaleel White</a> while also admitting that Family Matters’ change in focus was a shock. “We were all happy to be working, and he made the show go, and we’re all still happy about it right now. We’re still laughing to the bank with the residuals. So it may have caused a little conflict, just because… it was a real shocker to all of us, you know what I mean? Because he was this little character”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elsewhere in the same interview, Jo Marie Payton brought up the fact that she co-starred with White for many years which she cited as proof that rumors of tension between them was silly. It is also worth noting that in the aforementioned Jaleel White Entertainment Weekly interview, he stated that over time, he grew close with all of his Family Matters co-stars including Payton. “But I do think they do deserve credit at times for having helped foster a more harmonious environment by season 3, by season 4, by season 5. And we did become very much a family."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Jaleel White Making To Play Steve Urkel On 'Family Matters'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jo-marie-payton-hate-starring-in-family-matters>Did Jo Marie Payton Hate Starring In Family Matters?</h2><p>Even though Jo Marie Payton and Jaleel White have both thrown water on the idea that there was long-lasting tension between them, that doesn’t negate the possibility that she hated starring in Family Matters. After all, it is extremely notable that Payton ceased starring in Family Matters halfway through the show’s final season which forced her character to be recast. During the aforementioned 2010 tvseriesfinale.com interview, Payton called starring in Family Matters a “blessing” and expressed her appreciation for the show’s legacy and her co-stars. However, when she took part in a 2017 Family Matters reunion, she made it clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Payton wanted to leave Family Matters years before she did</a> because she had grown restless in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I actually made the decision to leave the show two years before I left. I was unhappy about a lot of things; I was going through a divorce, I wasn’t happy on the show — it didn’t mean I did not want to perform as an actress or an artist. The way I explain it is that, when you’re a baker, you don’t always want to bake cakes or cookies; you want to bake pies, you want to bake bread. I wanted to do something else.”</p><p>Based on all of those quotes, it seems clear that claiming Jo Marie Payton hated starring in Family Matters would be a huge overstatement. Still, there is no doubt that Payton was over the show in the end and she even told tvseriesfinale.com that Family Matters should have ended earlier. “I think that maybe my leaving, like I said, it kind of upset a few people but like I said, you know, it was time for me to go. It was time for the show to go, I wish we could’ve gone down maybe a little bit earlier”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How '90s Sitcom Star Jo Marie Payton's Career Has Evolved</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqGWdlr%2BqsYypmLKsn6N6uLTYZqmeqJyWsKawjKilZp6RoratxYymmK2slafAbrvRop6ippGheqmt0augnqykmnq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./espn-reporter-laura-sanko-and-james-krause-are-good-friends-479086-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ESPN Reporter Laura Sanko And James Krause Are Good Friends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dankani-guest-palace-hotel-sokoto.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dankani Guest Palace Hotel, Sokoto</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
