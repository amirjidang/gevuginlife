The acclaimed actor also has a pretty strained relationship with his family, particularly his father, Jeffrey Craig.</p><p>"The only thing my father gave me that was of any value to me is pain. The only time my dad will ever talk to me is when I need him at work," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia said of his relationship with his dad </a>in a 2014 interview with Interview Magazine. “We service each other. I use him when I go to work. It's not a real conversation; it's just an excuse to rev up. He's the marionette puppeteer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With such a twisted dynamic, it's no wonder that when Shia LaBeouf and his now ex-wife Mia Goth took the plunge into matrimony in 2016, Jeffrey Craig was nowhere to be seen.</p><h2 id=why-was-shia-labeouf-rsquo-s-dad-not-among-the-guests-at-his-wedding-with-mia-goth>Why Was Shia LaBeouf’s Dad Not Among The Guests At His Wedding With Mia Goth?</h2><p>Though the eccentric Las Vegas nuptials didn't exactly feature an extensive guest list, LaBeouf's mom, Shayna Saide, was spotted beaming alongside the happy couple, suggesting that LaBeouf had wanted at least one of his family members to share in his special day. So, why was Jeffrey Craig noticeably absent from the unconventional nuptials?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shia-labeouf-and-mia-goth.jpg><p>Well, as it’d later come to light during his 2019 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Shia LaBeouf and his dad weren’t exactly in talking terms at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was in this 'head camp' they sent me to, and I wrote the first chunk," LaBeouf said of writing the script for his 2019 film, Honey Boy, in which he plays a fictionalized version of his dad. "When I got home, I hadn't seen my dad in seven years and my director, Alma Har'el, who's a wizard, she was like, 'You need to go see your dad.' So I went and saw my dad, recorded that, came home and I had the ending, wrestled it down and that was the process."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-shia-labeouf-ban-his-dad-from-his-wedding-with-mia-goth_-here-s-why-he-wasn-t-among-the-guests.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s more, at the time of the nuptials, Jeffrey Craig was already three years into his on-the-lam lifestyle in Costa Rica. According to MailOnline, the ex-clown had fled the US and moved to a remote mountain community in the tropical paradise in 2013 after failing to update his details with the sexual offenders’ registry.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 virtual interview with Gen’s Aaron Gell</a>, Jeffrey Craig clarified that he wasn’t exactly on the run or hiding out from law enforcement, but had merely grown weary of keeping up with his registration requirements.</p><p>“I promised Shia if he got nominated I would go back to LA. I’m not wanted for anything,” he said. “I squeak going around corners. But I got tired of dealing with Megan’s Law. A person commits a crime, and they’re on me for the rest of my life. I haven’t committed no crimes since 1980. Megan’s Law needs to look at itself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-shia-labeouf-angry-at-his-father-for-missing-his-wedding-to-mia-goth>Was Shia LaBeouf Angry At His Father For Missing His Wedding To Mia Goth?</h2><p>Given the longstanding tension in their relationship, it's quite likely that Jeffrey Craig wasn't invited to Shia LaBeouf's wedding to Mia Goth. What's more, it's quite unlikely that LaBeouf was bothered about his dad missing out on the eccentric nuptials.</p><p>In his 2014 interview with Interview Magazine, LaBeouf admitted that, though he'd like to have a closer relationship with his dad, he considers their manipulative dynamic much more valuable.</p><p>“I love my dad. I'd love to be closer to my dad,” he said. “But we've got something going on between us that's really valuable to me right now, more valuable to me than having a father. And I financially support his whole lifestyle. I pay him to be my marionette puppeteer."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/how-is-shia-labeouf-as-a-dad_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the acclaimed actor might have changed his tune since then, as that wouldn't be the last time Jeffrey Craig would remain conspicuously absent during a crucial moment in his life. During his 2022 appearance on Jon Bernthal's Real Ones podcast, LaBeouf revealed that none of his family members, including his father, had visited him during his 2020 stint in an inpatient rehabilitation center in Utah.</p><p>“Everybody's family pops up on the screen, and week one no one shows up for me,” he said. “No one. They got the calls, I know they got the calls. But no one showed up. My mother, my father, no one. No one showed up.

So I'm sitting in this room, and even the person whose like therapizing me, she's starting to feel like this, she's empathizing with where I'm at,” he said. “Everybody else in the room... this isn't just alcoholics and s**t, this is like f**king arsonists and child predators and all kinds of wild people in this group, and they got people showing up for them.
