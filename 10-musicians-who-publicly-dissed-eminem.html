The competitive nature that runs through him propelled him to be one of the most bonafide rap stars and the greatest to grace the mic ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Little Known Facts About Eminem’s Family</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, his success also attracted, not one, but many haters. Over 20 years of his career, Eminem had several run-ins with other rappers and musicians who were also eager to overthrow him. From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg</a>, here are the top ten artists who have publicly dissed the Rap God.</p><h2 id=ja-rule><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ja Rule</span></h2><p>Ja Rule and Eminem have a perplexing relationship. It all started when Eminem and Dr. Dre signed then-blacklisted artist 50 Cent, who is a well-documented&nbsp;nemesis of Ja Rule, under a joint Shady/Aftermath deal. Eminem tried to stay out of it, as he confessed in his song Like Toy Soldiers, but he couldn't. Ja Rule ended up name-dropping Em's daughter in diss track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loose Change</a>.</p><h2 id=benzino><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Benzino</span></h2><p>Raymond 'Benzino' Scott was the man behind music magazine 'The Source,' which was considered the 'Bible' of hip-hop back in the days. The album helped several up-and-coming artists, including Eminem in the late 1990s, rise up thanks to its 'Unsigned Hype' column.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jealous of his success, Benzino called Eminem a '2003 Vanilla Ice' and a 'culture vulture.' He dropped two diss tracks targeting Eminem, titled "Pull Your Skirt Up" and "Die Another Day."</p><h2 id=canibus><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Canibus</span></h2><p>Canibus and Eminem's feud started off as a misunderstanding. When Eminem dropped The Slim Shady LP back in 1999, Eminem didn't respond to Bus' offer to collaborate on a track.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Refuse To Support Ice Cube’s New Music, Still Upset Over His Alliance With Donald Trump</a></span></p><p>Back in the days, Canibus had an ongoing beef against LL Cool J, Eminem's favorite emcee, and many accused Em of ghostwriting Cool J's diss track against Canibus. Canibus launched a verbal attack against Em on "Close to Me."</p><h2 id=icp><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>ICP</span></h2><p>Insane Clown Posse (ICP) is a Detroit-based hip-hop duo, consisting of Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. The feud started way back to 1997 when underground Eminem handed flyers for the Slim Shady EP release party, with an unconfirmed invitation for ICP. The duo released a parody song of Eminem's hit "My Name Is" and called Em some disturbing names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mariah Carey</span></h2><p>Eminem and Mariah Carey were the hottest artists of the 2000s, hence many publications covered their alleged relationship back in the day. Eminem confirmed the relationship, but Carey vehemently denied it, due to Eminem's public image as a controversial rapper. The feud escalated into several jabs, including Carey's 2009 single "Obsessed."</p><h2 id=nick-cannon><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nick Cannon</span></h2><p>Eminem clapped back against Carey, and name-dropped her and her then-husband Nick Cannon on "Bagpipes from Baghdad" from Relapse album and "The Warning."</p><p>This was back in 2009, and since then, many had forgotten all about the feud. However, Canon brought it back up out of the blue in 2019, when he released back-to-back diss tracks aimed towards Em: "The Invitation," "The Invitation Canceled," and "Pray for Him."</p><h2 id=suge-knight><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Suge Knight</span></h2><p>Former Death Row boss Suge Knight was accused of attempted murder against Eminem on two occasions in the early 2000s. Em's former bodyguard, Byron Williams, detailed the incidents on <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Murder Master Music Show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Is Rapper Logic Adding To His $14 Million Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Eminem was one of the hottest rappers back in the early 2000s, and his association with Knight's former rappers, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, are likely the reasons Suge felt animosity toward Eminem. The now-inmate even jumped on Nick Cannon's "The Invitation" diss track.</p><h2 id=limp-bizkit><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Limp Bizkit</span></h2><p>Rock band Limp Bizkit had a murky exchange of words with Eminem in the early 2000s after their collaboration with the rapper, "Turn Me Loose," was left off their 1999 album Significant Other. They were all friends until DJ Lethal, one of the band's members, told MTV's TRL that Everlast, a former member of House of Pain, would beat Eminem in a fistfight. Eminem saw this as a backstabbing act, especially when Em had a feud with Everlast at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=snoop-dogg><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Snoop Dogg</span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg's beef with Eminem was a confusing and polarizing one, especially for someone who used to call Em the "great white American hope." Snoop uttered that he "could live without Eminem's music any day" in an episode of The Breakfast Club, to which Eminem responded on "Zeus" from Music to Be Murdered By - Side B. Fortunately, it seems Snoop and Eminem have called a truce off camera.</p><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Machine Gun Kelly</span></h2><p>Lastly, we have Machine Gun Kelly, Eminem's only feud in recent years that received massive media attention. Many believed it all started over MGK's tweet about Eminem's then-15-year-old daughter Hailie, but according to Em, MGK made some subliminal shots against him on a song with Tech N9ne, "No Reason." Eminem name-dropped Kelly on "Not Alike" from Kamikaze, prompting a response from the Cleveland rapper with "Rap Devil."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Gun Kelly Tries Promoting His Movie, But All Fans Want Is His Cool Jacket</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWdqsCqr8iapaxlp528brzUm6Oim5yueqW10qycnWWVoravscxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./highest-selling-sports-jerseys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 Highest Selling Sports Jerseys</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-who-live-with-adhd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Celebs Who Live With ADHD</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
