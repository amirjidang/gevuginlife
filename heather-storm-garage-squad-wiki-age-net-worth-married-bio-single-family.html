Storm, whose nationality is American, is best known as a co-host of the reality TV series “Garage Squad”. In addition to that, she is a social media influencer and blogger.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So just how rich is Heather Storm as of early 2019? According to authoritative sources, Heather has a net worth of over $1.7 million, with her wealth being accumulated from her career in the previously mentioned field. She hasn’t revealed any information regarding her assets, such as houses and cars, but working steadily, she has been able to establish herself and be financially stable.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=background-and-family></span>Background and Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When it comes to Storm’s ethnicity, she is Caucasian, and has blonde hair and brown eyes, which suits her complexion perfectly, and judging from the photos available online, she has a fit figure. Reportedly, Heather and her family relocated to Montana when she was 12 years old, which changed her life dramatically, as she has said. Nonetheless, her father had influence on her and gave her strength, teaching her to become an independent young girl. During her formative years, she enjoyed hiking and riding, and steadily developed a love for nature. Speaking about her education, she was a student of Oregon State, from where she graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, and then went on to work in Puerto Rico. She spent most of her free time on outdoor activities, such as exploring the beaches and surfing. After that, the future TV star moved to Los Angeles, where she worked as a model, brand ambassador and fitness trainer, slowly building her portfolio, and ultimately becoming a renowned TV star.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-heather-married-relationship-status></span>Is Heather Married? Relationship Status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Remaining secretive about her private life, Heather doesn’t share any information about her relationship status, nor has she spoken about any ex-boyfriends. This has led many to believe that she is unmarried as of today, and has never been married and doesn’t have any children, but we believe that she has a bright future ahead of her, romatically.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=social-media></span>Social Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being in the entertainment field naturally means that Storm is active on social media, such as Twitter and Instagram, and uses it to communicate with her fans as well as to promote her business. Her Twitter account is followed by close to 10,000 people who enjoy her content. One of her latest posts includes a photo of herself, re-tweeted from The Celebrity Café, with the caption reading “Girls can talk about cars too!
