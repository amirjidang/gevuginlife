Her husband is more popular than her because he is one of the most successful club coaches with two premierships, four championships including a continental title.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, she previously worked as a marketing manager at South Melbourne. During that time, Ange was working as the manager of the club. Maybe, she is continuing her job.
