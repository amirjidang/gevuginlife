I’m like, ‘Wait, are you sure [this is my baby]?’ You can’t lose this thing!”</p><p>Rihanna and partner <strong>ASAP Rocky</strong> welcomed RZA in May 2022. Earlier this year, the “Diamonds” singer revealed during her performance at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show that she was expecting her second child. She and the rapper, 35, welcomed son Riot, now 4 months, in August.</p><p>On Monday, Rihanna said that she loves Rocky (real name Rakim Mayers) “differently” as a dad. “It’s a turn-on. It’s just like, ‘Wow! What a leader, what a great, patient, loving [dad],’” she gushed. “And my kids are obsessed with him. I’m just a background [actor], I’m an extra. Yep! It happens! … It doesn’t matter if it’s girls or boys, they love their dad differently, and I love to see it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rihanna-Jokes-Her-Son-RZA-Has-Her-Forehead-3.jpg><p>Earlier this month, an insider exclusively told Us Weekly that Rihanna hasn’t ruled out <a href=#>having more kids</a> in the future.</p><p>“Rihanna adores her boys, but she’d still love to have a girl one day,” the source explained. “She’s always wanted lots of kids, so that’s definitely something they discussed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second insider noted that Rihanna and Rocky are “thrilled to be living out their dreams together.”</p><p>Last month, Rocky said that he thinks parenthood has been some of his and <a href=#>Rihanna’s best work so far</a>. “I think we do a real great job at collaborating making children,” he joked in an Instagram interview with Complex. “I think that’s our best creation so far! Nothing is better than [RZA and Riot] out there. I mean, we had a third designer come and help, a ghost designer named God, [who] shaped everything. And we had these beautiful angels.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2BtjKOmpJ2jYrWmvoxqZLKdkad6sLjDZqqopl2nx6J5x5qqZqCVp3qjtcZmnaiqlZ2yorCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rina-lipa-dua-lipas-sister-bio-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-siblings-sister-school-boyfriend-net-worth-and-wikipedia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rina Lipa (Dua Lipas Sister) Bio, Wiki, Age, Birthday, Height, Parents, Siblings, Sister, School,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./outdaughtereds-adam-danielle-busby-detail-marriage-growing-pains.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>OutDaughtereds Adam, Danielle Busby Detail Marriage 'Growing Pains'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
