The former couple dated for nearly two years after meeting on season 5 of BiP in 2018. <a href=#>On season</a> <a href=#>7,</a> Kendall had to navigate seeing Joe fall in love with <a href=#><strong>Serena Pitt</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kendall-Long-Implies-She-Was-Told-Joe-Was-Struggling-Before-Serena-Proposal.jpg><p>“Going back to the beach, I felt I had, like, a romanticism toward Paradise because it was such a romantic experience the first time I went. And then the second time I went, I really had hope for it to be that — not in terms of rekindling anything with my ex, because why would I do that publicly when we had a two-year relationship and there’s so much stuff we can’t talk about on TV? That would’ve taken more than a couple weeks in Mexico to fix,” Kendall explained on the Tuesday, May 17, <a href=#>episode of the “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast.</a> “But I really had hopes of being able to find someone and to connect with someone, and I did. I had a little romantic thing with Ivan [Hall] and that was great. But ultimately, seeing your ex in the place where you fell in love initially — it was very difficult for me and I didn’t anticipate that at all. I didn’t think I would be as emotional. I didn’t think that it would affect me. I thought we’d be cool, [we’d be] friends.”</p><p>Kendall told Us that she didn’t watch the episodes when they aired last summer, but it was hard for her to escape the reaction from viewers — many of whom accused her of still having feelings for Joe. There was more backlash when <a href=#>Kendall seemingly returned to talk to the Chicago native moments before he was set to propose to Serena.</a></p><p>“I was under the impression that Joe was going through a lot of mental difficulty with our relationship and me being there,” Kendall told Us. “And so, for me, coming back to talk to him, it would be a way to be like, ‘Hey, this chapter’s closed. It was kind of weird the way we ended it, but let’s make it not weird and let’s move on.’ <a href=#>[I had] no idea there would ever be any sort of proposal at all</a>. … And I even said, like, ‘If there’s gonna be a proposal, I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t want to go to the beach because that’s not my day — that’s their day.’”</p><p>As fans may recall, however, Joe <a href=#>did get down on one knee shortly after Kendall left the platform.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Finding out later that there was a proposal actually made me really upset and a bit angry,” Kendall continued. “But that’s just what it ended up being. And hopefully, the situation that took place didn’t affect — it seems to not [have] affected their relationship [in] any way or their proposal in any way. Hopefully, it felt just as special, but I would’ve preferred not to be there that day.”</p><p>For more from Kendall, including the details of her new relationship with boyfriend Mitch, listen to <a href=#>Us Weekly’s “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJon56qlWKzsL6MrZ%2BeZaKetKnAjKucmqufo8Bwt8Snm5qknGK5sLrGZq6aq12Wu6i%2B2GaqoZ1dmbalutNmoqenp2Kuo7vUrWSjp5ViwKa%2BxKeYZp2enK6oscyepa1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyyngg-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-170395-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyyngg Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-kiss-at-bruce-springsteen-show-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Kiss at Bruce Springsteen Show: Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
