So, we are leaving that up to the viewer’s imagination.”</p><p class=p1>The scene in question occurred about 19 minutes into the episode when Billie’s husband Cooper (<a href=#><strong>Mike Vogel</strong></a>) was curious about her history with ex-boyfriend Brad (Demos), enough to stalk him all the way to the gym. After watching Brad’s intense workout and post-exercise shower, Cooper got a peek at the record label executive’s manhood. <a href=#>According to the official script pages</a>, which the show’s Twitter account posted in July, the scene was initially very NSFW.</p><p class=p1>“As he does so, Cooper can’t help but lower his eyes to check out Brad’s package — the instrument that brought his wife so much pleasure,” part of the script read. “And S–T — his worst fears are confirmed. Cooper glances back up at Brad, feeling like more of an underdog than ever and guilty as hell he just checked him out.”</p><p class=p2>While Shahi remained quiet about the Australia native’s package during the interview, she was more forthcoming to share details about her experiences<a href=#> filming the intimate scenes together</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Watch-Sarah-Shahi-Awkwardly-Get-Asked-If-Real-Life-BF-Adam-Demos-Wore-a-Prosthetic-in-SexLife-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>“As an actor, we spend a lot of time sort of faking that kind of intimacy with somebody,” she added during the interview. “But what was interesting from my point of view is to fall for the person that you’re supposed to be falling for on camera, it kind of adds an extra bit. You’re kind of like, ‘Oh, I don’t know if this is anything I could have acted.’”</p><p class=p1>A week earlier, the real-life couple <a href=#>sat down to rewatch their rooftop sex scene from the show</a><span class=s1>, which was released in June,</span>&nbsp;for a video that was then posted onto the&nbsp;official <i>Sex/Life</i><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span>Instagram page.</p><p class=p2>“So weird! … It actually works,” Shahi said in the clip. “Is that it? Well, what do you want us to say? I think you did a good job, scene partner. My heart is still going.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>Shahi previously opened up about what drew her to the role of Billie and the liberating way sex was portrayed on this show.</p><p class=p2>“I’ve often felt that when you have sex scenes in film and television — unless it’s a lesbian piece — they’re kind of depicted through the male point of view. It’s often the woman having sex the way a man wants to have sex,” <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>City on a Hill</i>&nbsp;actor exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in June</a>. “I thought this was a real opportunity to flip that on its head. Now, you have female sexuality represented by women on screen. … I felt like this was such a statement, to show that we are these incredible sexual beings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqaqpGderS0wKGgZqGjYq60t8SdZKKeXZaxormMnZymp6NixLC%2BxGanq6ejqbWmwMicZKKmXaiyuXnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tai-strickland-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-187699-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tai Strickland Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-herrera-wife-who-is-ron-herrera-wife-487590-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ron Herrera Wife Who is Ron Herrera Wife?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
