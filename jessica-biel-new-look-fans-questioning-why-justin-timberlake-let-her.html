"Cute but noooooo, long hair flatters you more," one fan wrote. Another agreed, writing "Makes you look older." Other comments on the post include, "Nah girl, you a long hair girl," and "Instant regret." But it is the messages about Justin Timberlake that are bizarre (why would he have any say in his wife's decision to cut her hair?). "JT how could you let her do this," a comment reads, followed by a crying face emoji.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Someone is having a love breakdown ...

Others agree with this assessment, as a comment claims, "Radical hair change for women usually means a break up is on its way."</p><p>Some fans have criticized the negativity and defended Biel. "People can be so unkind!!! And we wonder why kids are mean," one comment reads. "You look beautiful!" Another fan also took note of the mean comments. "Wth?!! These comments are horrid. Your criticism is not as crucial as you think it may be," they wrote. "It's time to do a little inward evaluation and healing. Jessica, doing you, looks good on you."</p><p>"What are these hateful ass comments," an Instagram user wrote. "Let people thrive with what THEY like and support their styles.
