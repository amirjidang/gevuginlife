The group, which comprised of none other than Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick, completely took over the '90s, giving groups such as The Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls, and S Club 7 a run for their money! The boys gave us some of the best pop music, however, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their 90s outfits that got us all talking</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the clothes weren't enough, NSYNC also sported some funky hairstyles, many of which the gang is making fun of today! It goes without saying that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the members of the group definitely look different today</a>&nbsp;compared to then, however, a quick stroll down memory lane has us all wondering what a few of the group members were thinking. Here are the 90s hairstyles that NSYNC regrets today!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Which NSYNC Song Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?</a></span></p><h2 id=nsync-hairstyles-the-boys-regret-today>NSYNC Hairstyles The Boys Regret Today</h2><p>The 90s were definitely a special time when it comes to fashion and hairstyles, and it was very much apparent amongst the 90s boy band, NSYNC! The group released their self-titled debut album back in 1997 and completely took over the music industry by storm. With hit songs such as 'Bye Bye Bye', 'This I Promise You', and 'It's Gonna Be Me', to name a few, the members of NSYNC were unstoppable, becoming a competition to some of the biggest names at the time, including the Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls, and Britney Spears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with their talent when it came to making pop music, the boys were known for their extensive fashion choices, but more specifically, their hairstyles! We all know and love Justin Timberlake's ramen blonde hair, which he holds absolutely no guilt over, however, the same cannot be said for Chris Kirkpatrick. In a recent TikTok video, made by bandmates, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the duo poked fun at Chris' spikey blonde and black braids</a> that gave off the impression of a pineapple!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Are NSYNC's Justin Timberlake And Lance Bass Still Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The TikTok, which was also shared to Fatone's Instagram account, has<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Joey and Lance posing alongside a pineapple </a>while the photo morphs into an older pic of Joey, Lance, and Chris from the 90s. The jokes not only landed but had just about everyone laughing! Jordin Sparks wrote, 'Ahahahahahahah', as Lance claimed the post "literally made my day".</p><p>Kirkpatrick saw the humor in the photo, laughing along with the rest of us! While it was definitely a bold choice, it is one that Chris will not be exploring any time soon. Despite NSYNC giving us some rather questionable outfits, the music was always on point, which is all that matters!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Group Once Beat Out NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, & One Direction As 'Best Boy Band'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVYq6zsYytn55lmJa2s7%2FTsqOeq11ufbR5wZqlnWWeqMavr4yrnKCqlanAbsDOnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-is-rolonda-rochelle-age-and-wikipedia-details-of-the-actress-from-big-50-the-delrhonda-hood-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Is Rolonda Rochelle?
