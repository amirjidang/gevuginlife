You can read a few highlights below:&nbsp;</p><p>“It all adds to your character, whether it be visually or verbally, it’s just something that people can relate to. Anybody who’s a fan of Jordans&nbsp;and happens to have on the same pair of shoes I’m wearing when I’m in the ring has something to relate to with my character.”</p><p class=ng-scope>It’s actually a funny story. I used to wear wrestling boots when I first got signed to the WWE. It was mandatory that each and every single superstar under contract buy and wear boots, or wear&nbsp;amateur&nbsp;wrestling shoes, which are thin cut. It wasn’t a stipulation in our contract or anything, but when you showed up to wrestling school, the head coach would say “Hey do you got your wrestling boots?” So I had to go out and buy wrestling boots, which I had never worn before in my life. I did not feel comfortable in them.</p><p class=ng-scope>What ended up happening was I had a freak incident where I broke my leg in training in the performance center while wearing wrestling boots. It wasn’t so much “Oh, he was wearing wrestling boots,” but in my mind I was like “It’s the wrestling boot.”</p><p class=ng-scope>If you ever looked at the spectrum of people in the company wearing sneakers for a long period of time, it’s only John Cena. When I broke my leg I came to our head coach with a doctor’s note that said “Enzo needs to be wearing sneakers when he wrestles because he broke his leg and that’s what he feels comfortable in.” Breaking my leg was the be-all, end-all of wrestling boots [for me], and I turned it into an opportunity to capitalize on a market that I am infatuated with. When I came back, the first pair of shoes I wore when I got in the ring was the Ferrari 14&nbsp;Jordans.</p><p class=ng-scope>Oh, of course. I grew up a New York Knicks fan, a New York Giants fan, and a New York Yankees fan, so being in the area for &nbsp;hip-hop culture, sneakers and Jordan, you’re&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;see a little bit of that in my outfit, I assure you. That sneakerwatch is going to be serious. Sneakerheads are going to be scratching their heads like, “Is he really gonna one-and-done those?” It’s kind of like Ric Flair back in the day talking about his $2,000 alligator shoes. “I’m having a hard time holding these alligators down.” &nbsp;It’s 2016 and they’re not alligator sneakers, they’re Jordan Brand shoes and Enzo is going out and one-and-done’ing them.</p><p class=ng-scope>I’m #1 hands down in the business and in the game right now. Shane McMahon might give me a run for my money. First&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<a href=#>he’s got some customs that he wore on his feet at WrestleMania this past year</a>&nbsp;that are probably worth&nbsp;more than my collection alone. I think Tinker Hatfield made him a pair of&nbsp;30s&nbsp;or&nbsp;31s&nbsp;or something that was custom that he wore. It stops for me at about 14 because I don’t really wear much past that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5NrbmlvXZq7u7uMmqSoqpViwaK4yqxksJ2Rp7avs4yjpquckaPAbsDOZq6rnaOpuaZ5x6iuZqCVYsC1rdGtnJ1lp5qus7XNoGSsppWWuKa%2B0magp2WknbJuvsinnmavmKR6qa3SZquhnV2XsrTAjKyfqJ1dnK6usYyipWavp5o%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erika-christensen-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-2015711.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erika Christensen: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1342194-elimination-chamber-qualifying-matches-cody-rhodes-ripleys-decision-set-for-1-30-wwe-raw.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elimination Chamber Qualifying Matches, Cody Rhodes, Ripleys Decision Set For 1/30 WWE RAW</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
