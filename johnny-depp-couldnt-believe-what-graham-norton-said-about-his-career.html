Instead, his humbleness shines through with every interview he does.

You've turned the character actor into a global superstar."</p><p>"No, I think it's more like some form of schizophrenia that has just worked for me," Depp said.</p><p>Depp went on to explain, "What I enjoy really is the sort of extreme quiet at the end of the first take.

But just how that creative process works or where genius strikes differs for each role that Depp plays.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-39-s-process-when-it-comes-to-creating-signature-characters>Johnny Depp's Process When It Comes To Creating Signature Characters</h2><p><a href=#>When Depp comes up with characters for his films, he physically changes to become that character</a>. Many times he bases the characters he portrays on real people. <a href=#>Johnny has even been inspired by talk show hosts</a>.</p><p>Other times, inspiration comes to Depp when in a relaxed state, like being in a sauna, as Depp explained while on The Graham Norton Show. This is how Depp came up with how Captain Jack Sparrow would behave in the <strong><a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean</a></strong> films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Do you come to the set with these fully formed or do you work with the director or how does it happen that you create those?" Norton asked Depp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/johnny-depp-felt-watching-children-s-show-hosts-to-develop-his-willy-wonka-character-wasn-t-creepy-enough.jpg><p>Depp replied, "Yeah, generally they're born out of whatever they're born out of. I've had them... born out of the sauna, being an extreme."</p><p>This process of being in a sauna is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something that Depp did intentionally to affect his state of mind</a>. Had the Edward Scissorhands star not done this, his iconic swashbuckler character may never have been born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This sounds weird but Captain Jack was born in a sauna. My sauna," Depp explained. "I was looking at various aspects of the character and I figured this guy has been on the high seas for the majority of his life and therefore has dealt with inescapable heat to the brain. So I cranked the sauna up to about 1000 degrees and sat in there as long as I could until it started to affect me mentally. It was very, very hot, as was my brain."</p><p>Depp went on to say, "While you’re in there in that kind of heat you can’t stand still, but the worst of it is if you move, it kills you. So that gave me the idea that his brain has been par-boiled to some degree. Also in terms of his body language, I felt that when he was on the ship he would be fine as the ship would be bounding away. He would have sea legs, but when he gets on land he cannot get land legs."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Johnny Depp Really Change The Shape Of His Face For Willy Wonka In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Johnny Depp went to great lengths to make his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as authentic as possible.</span><p>This idea of how Captain Jack Sparrow should behave was not something that Disney agreed with.

Depp, in his cheeky manner, called Gervais out on it.</p><p>"You can feel it coming on, can't you?" Depp asked the audience.</p><p>"Don't pick on me," Gervais said laughing. "The audience are always going to be on your side."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This is a true statement based on the comments received from the YouTube clip of Depp on The Graham Norton Show.</p><p>"Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors of our time!" one fan stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A second fan commented, "JD has always been one of my all-time favorite actors for the quirky characters he chooses to take on."</p><p>"'The audience is always going to be on your side.'
