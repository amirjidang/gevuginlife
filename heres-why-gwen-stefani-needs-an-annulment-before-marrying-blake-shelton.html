To recap: Divorced? Check. Engaged? Check. So why does Gwen need an annulment from her ex?</p><p>That's what fans are asking after reports surfaced about Gwen's recent annulment application. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, The Vatican has just given Gwen's application an answer. Read on to learn what that's all about.</p><h2 id=gwen-is-deeply-religious>Gwen Is Deeply Religious</h2><p>Gwen Stefani is actually really into religion (specifically Roman Catholicism) so marriage is very important to her. Because annulments are recognized by the Catholic Church as the official end of a marriage, it was essential for Gwen to go this route after being married to Gavin for 14 years.</p><p>If you learned about annulments from marriage-obsessed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross on 'Friends'</a> (no shame) you might be surprised to learn that they can be awarded even if a marriage has been consummated. That's definitely the case for Gwen and Gavin, who had three biological children together but were still eligible to get annulled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale's Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=an-annulment-will-legitimize-her-divorce>An Annulment Will 'Legitimize' Her Divorce</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2015</a>, the sitting Catholic Pope opted to change rules for divorced people who hoped to remarry. He declared that they would have to go through a detailed (and sometimes costly) application process of annulment to "legitimize" their new marriages, but could choose to fast-track their annulments by seeking them through a local parish instead of through The Vatican itself.</p><p>Gwen chose to get her annulment from the actual Vatican, so it's likely partly responsible for her and Blake not getting married sooner. This process would have involved Gwen submitting a '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Declaration of Nullity</a>' that claimed her marriage to Gavin was 'not valid' at the time they spoke their vows. "Deceit" is the most common reason for people to claim their marriage contracts were invalid, so it's likely that Gwen and Gavin had to prove that one or both of them were lying when they vowed to stay faithful, support each other through thick and thin, and so on.
