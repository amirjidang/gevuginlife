This has had great impact on me and my household. Because of this, I have made the decision to no longer feature Hudson on Instagram, my tv shows or any social platforms until he is old enough to make this decision for himself.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I have always been fine not having Hudson appear on public platforms and have made that clear.
