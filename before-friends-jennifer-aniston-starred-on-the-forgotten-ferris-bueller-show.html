During that time, Aniston landed the role of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Green</a> on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a> and became one of the biggest names of the entire decade. Since then, she has continued to add to her legacy with roles in other successful projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before becoming a household name, Aniston was an actress looking for her big break, and at one point, the actress was part of a show that was tied to&nbsp;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. This forgotten show has been buried deep in television history, and the show itself is more bizarre than people would know.</p><p>Let’s take a look back at Jennifer Aniston’s time on&nbsp;Ferris Bueller.</p><h2 id=it-was-meant-to-show-the-ferris-the-movie-was-based-on>It Was Meant To Show The Ferris The Movie Was Based On</h2><p>There are a number of 80s movies that wound up being turned into forgettable television shows, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferris Bueller</a> has got to be one of the weirdest ideas ever conceived. The movie is a timeless classic, but the show came nowhere close to matching what the movie was able to achieve.</p><p>In short, this show was about the real Ferris Bueller who the movie was based on. Yes, in this ill-conceived fictional universe, there is an actual Ferris Bueller and the movie that we all saw was about this guy and his high school hijinks. Instead of being a continuation of the story we saw or even a prequel, the folks making the show chose to go a wildly different route.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was the premise of the show completely different from the film, but the entire cast was swapped out. This does make sense when considering that this was intended to shine a light on the real Bueller clan. On the series, Jennifer Aniston was cast as Jeannie, Ferris’ sister. Jeannie is played by Jennifer Grey in the original, and we have to wonder how she felt about the show debuting back in the 90s.</p><p>Even though the show had the Ferris Bueller name and even a young Jennifer Aniston as part of the cast, it was unable to live up to any sort of expectations that had been placed on it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston’s Biggest Roles (Apart From ‘Rachel Green’)</a></span></p><h2 id=ferris-bueller-lasted-for-one-season>Ferris Bueller Lasted For One Season</h2><p>It is always interesting to look back at an actor’s career to see how things were going before making it, and despite landing a role on a show based on a successful movie, things did not work out so well for Jennifer Aniston during her time on&nbsp;Ferris Bueller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In total, the show was only able to last for a single season on the small screen. We imagine that the network greenlit the show with the belief that its loose relation to the movie would catapult it to success, but clearly, fans were more than happy to just rewatch the movie as opposed to tuning into a show that lacked the original cast and the charm of its predecessor.</p><p>For Jennifer Aniston, this must have come as a tough break. Landing a role on a show is already hard enough, but to get one early on and have it not work out can be demoralizing. This acting credit was going to stick with her moving forward, but as time went on, she was able to continue auditioning for roles, eventually landing one that changed her life forever.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Feel Bad For Matthew Perry Post-‘Friends’ For This Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-eventually-books-friends>Jennifer Aniston Eventually Books&nbsp;Friends</h2><p>In 1994, three years after&nbsp;Ferris Bueller came to an end, Jennifer Aniston started her time on the show&nbsp;Friends, and unlike&nbsp;Ferris Bueller, this show would become an instant success that soon made its way to the top of television. In the blink of an eye, Jennifer Aniston was a genuine television star.</p><p>Friends would run from 1994 to 2004, airing over 200 episodes and becoming one of the most loved shows of all time. Aniston became an icon of the 90s with her hair and fashion, and since the show came to an end, it has continued to thrive in syndication and on streaming platforms, hauling in legions of new fans every single year. In fact, the show has been such a success that Jennifer Aniston is estimated to still be making around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million</a> a year from&nbsp;Friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Hold Guinness World Records</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, many people have been able to look at the triumphs of Jennifer Aniston’s career, which means that seemingly no one remembers her time on&nbsp;Ferris Bueller.&nbsp;We all have to start somewhere, and even though the show was a disaster, Jennifer Aniston was able to persevere in the business and become a legend in her own right.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter In A Rage As Cringy David Letterman’s Interview With Jennifer Aniston Resurfaces</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnp6fp7JustGinKeco2K3prrNop2eql2Wu6q%2F06ilZquklr%2BzscNmpqdlpJ2ybrLOq56orKSau26yxKupoqtdl8KmuMueqWarmKTEcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-friendship-ex-housekeeper-criminal-history-sam-asghari-divorce-cheated-employee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Forms Unlikely Bond With Her Ex-Housekeeper During Divorce, But He Has A Dangerous Pa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aventer-gray-weight-loss-ig-age-clothing-line-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aventer Gray Weight Loss, IG, Age, Clothing Line, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
