While her acting prowess opened doors for many Hollywood projects and brand collaborations, Taylor-Joy's appearance became the subject of online discussions.</p><p>When fans noticed her changing appearance, speculations arose about <a href=#>Taylor-Joy's alleged buccal fat removal and cosmetic procedures</a>. While the actress has not publicly commented on the rumors, a resurfaced interview with <a href=#>Taylor-Joy discusses how she was bullied at school</a> and online due to her facial features.</p><h2 id=anya-taylor-joy-was-unaware-of-her-wide-set-eyes-until-the-media-pointed-it-out>Anya Taylor-Joy Was Unaware Of Her Wide-Set Eyes Until The Media Pointed It Out</h2><p>Back in 2016, when Anya Taylor-Joy was just 20 years old, she was interviewed by W Magazine about her burgeoning career and the newfound intensity of her fame. During the interview, the discussion took an immediate turn toward whether <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor-Joy had ever felt self-conscious about her facial features</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Anya-Taylor-Joy-Shares-Emotional-Post-After-Being-Back-In-Argentina.jpg><p>The very first question posed to the actress was about her distinctive eyes and whether they made her self-conscious. Taylor-Joy responded and shared her heartbreaking experience when she was made aware of her eye placement after being tagged in a Facebook photo where her eyes were humorously compared to a fish.</p><p>The cruel comparison deeply affected her, leaving her upset and reluctant to look at herself in mirrors for a long time.</p><p>"I was really upset about it, and I didn't enjoy it. I kind of stopped looking in mirrors for a very long time. I still don't really spend a lot of time in front of mirrors because I don't really have to deal with my face. Unfortunately, y'all do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor-Joy went on to mention that she was still in the process of growing into herself but felt a lot less awkward as time went on.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><th scope=row><p>Anya Taylor-Joy Full Name</p></th><td><p>Anya-Josephine Marie Taylor-Joy</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Birthdate</p></th><td><p>April 16, 1996</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Birthplace</p></th><td><p>Miami, Florida</p></td></tr><tr><th colspan=1 rowspan=2 scope=row><p>Parents</p></th><td><p>Dennis Alan Taylor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jennifer Marina Joy</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Husband</p></th><td><p>Malcolm McRae (married - October 2023)</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Net Worth</p></th><td><p>$7 Million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>When these past comments from Taylor-Joy resurfaced on social media, her fans quickly rallied to defend and support the actress. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans posted tweets praising her beauty</a> while others took the opportunity to discuss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">society's unrealistic beauty standards</a>, highlighting the pressure individuals face to conform to a narrow definition of beauty perpetuated by the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another interesting fact about Taylor-Joy's eyes is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she doesn't boast a 20/20 vision</a>. In an interview with Marie Claire, the actress revealed, "I've got really bad eyesight, so I can't see my reflection in car windows or anything." ​​​​However, this visual limitation has led to a heightened sense of smell and a unique method for getting into character.</p><p>Anya Taylor-Joy told Vanity Fair that her heightened sense of smell was influenced by her poor eyesight:</p><p>"I've always been obsessed with scent because I have really terrible eyesight. ...As I started getting a bit older, I became obsessed with apothecaries, and I mixed my own scents with notes like damask rose and black pepper, or things that are a bit spicy and out of this world..."</p><p>Taylor-Joy also emphasized the significance of these scents in grounding herself and mentioned her strong attachment to them while traveling. Additionally, for certain film characters, Taylor-Joy curates her scent to instantly immerse herself in a specific mindset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-anya-taylor-joy-39-s-insecurities-influence-her-to-undergo-plastic-surgery>Did Anya Taylor-Joy's Insecurities Influence Her To Undergo Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>As Anya Taylor-Joy grew in the spotlight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors about her alleged plastic surgery began circulating</a>. In January 2021, an Instagram fan account, @celebplastic, shared comparative images of the actress with the caption "Then and now." Twitter users also joined the speculation, with one tweet in January 2023 saying that Taylor-Joy now resembles a rich celebrity with expensive plastic surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/are-anya-taylor-joy-s-buccal-fat-removal-and-plastic-surgery-rumors-based-in-any-truth_.jpg><p>A discussion on Reddit also speculated about the reasons behind Taylor-Joy's perceived physical changes and the procedures she may have undergone.

Instead, she has been candid about her experiences with bullying, particularly related to her wide-set eyes.
