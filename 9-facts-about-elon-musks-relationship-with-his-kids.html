His most recent child was born in 2021, while his first was born in 2002. During that time, Musk has had three committed partnerships, with two of those ladies as co-parents.

He suddenly died from sudden infant death syndrome at 10 weeks (SIDS). According to an essay by Wilson for Marie Claire in 2010, Nevada laid down for a nap and stopped breathing while lying on his back as usual. He had no oxygen for so long when the paramedics revived him that he was brain-dead. Before doctors decided to remove him from life support, he was kept alive for three days in a hospital in Orange County.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=musk-and-griffin><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Musk And Griffin</span></h2><p>Less than two months after Nevada's passing, Elon's ex-wife Wilson paid her first visit to an IVF clinic.

Gender identity and the fact that she no longer lives with or want to be related to her biological father in any manner, shape, or form are listed as the reasons for the name change in the file.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Disgusting Reason Why Elon Musk Is Estranged From His Father, Errol">The Disgusting Reason Why Elon Musk Is Estranged From His Father, Errol</a></span></p><h2 id=musk-and-the-triplets><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Musk And The Triplets</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kai, Saxon, and Damian were the names of the triplets that Wilson gave birth to in 2006, two years after having twins.

Despite going by the moniker "X," Grimes clarified how to pronounce him in her Instagram comments.</p><h2 id=musk-and-exa-dark-sider-aelig-l><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Musk And Exa Dark Sideræl</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Three months after the couple's public divorce in 2021, his ex-girlfriend Grimes disclosed in a Vanity Fair interview a year later that<a href=#> she had given birth to a daughter</a> through surrogacy. The singer-songwriter Exa Dark Siderael claimed that her name has two meanings. Exa stands for exaFLOPS, a supercomputing phrase, and Dark stands for the unknowable. People fear it, she said, but in reality, it's the absence of photons. Our universe's magnificent mystery is dark matter. Star time, deep space-time, and not our relative earth time are all used to define the third part of Y's full name, Sideræl.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Grimes Posts Cringey TikTok About Elon Musk's Hotness">Grimes Posts Cringey TikTok About Elon Musk's Hotness</a></span></p><h2 id=musk-and-his-kids-39-education><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Musk And His Kids' Education</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk claimed in an interview</a> that YouTube and Reddit played a significant role in his children's education.

Musk said his children had gained knowledge from their peers at Musk's Ad Astra school. His children and the children of SpaceX employees are educated at the school he co-founded in 2014.
