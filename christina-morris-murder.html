CCTV footage helped authorities identify Enrique Arochi, a one-time acquaintance of Morris, as the prime suspect in her disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>The two were seen walking together and entering a parking lot in the early morning, which was the last time Morris was alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Arochi was eventually found guilty of kidnapping based on solid evidence linking him to the case, and the search for Morris continued. In 2018, her skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in Anna, Texas.</p><p>At the time of her disappearance, Morris was back in her hometown of Plano for the Labor Day weekend. She was last seen near The Shops at Legacy at 3:55 am on August 30, 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Three days later, her car was found in a parking garage, but no sign of her. Hunter Foster, Morris’ then-boyfriend, was initially suspected of involvement in her disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, authorities dismissed him as a suspect after searching through mobile phone data, toll road records, and speaking with witnesses.</p><p>As the leads regarding Morris’ whereabouts dwindled, her family, friends, and loved ones continued to search for her every week, focusing their efforts on Anna, a small town with farmlands.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, construction workers found her partial skeletal remains in a field in the town. The cause of death was either not determined or has not been made public.</p><p>When investigators found Morris’ car, they reviewed the surveillance tapes from the parking lot and noticed that she entered the location with a male. The male was identified as Enrique Gutierrez Arochi, an acquaintance from high school.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends reported that Arochi was romantically interested in Morris, but she was not reciprocating. One friend noted that Arochi looked almost angry when he offered to walk.&nbsp;</p><p>Morris went to her car after she announced she wanted to head home. They went into the garage, but only Arochi drove out three minutes later.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZo65uuc6rqaKrXaLCs7DEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-richest-members-of-the-ross-family-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Richest Members Of The Ross Family, Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-brews-the-10-most-expensive-cups-of-coffees-in-the-world.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Most Expensive Cups Of Coffees In The World</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
