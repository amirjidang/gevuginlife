However, it wasn’t the first time she considered having children.</p><p>During a 2018 interview with <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>, the “Without Me” singer shared that she’d talked about her future as a mother with then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>G-Eazy</strong></a> and detailed her battle with endometriosis.</p><p>“I’m <a href=#>freezing my eggs at 23.</a> My doctor’s like, ‘You’re the youngest patient I’ve ever had. Also, nothing like having a new partner and being like, ‘By the way, I need to know if you want to have kids right now, because if you don’t, I need to go date someone else,'” the two-time Grammy nominee said at the time. “I have a very limited window of time. You know what I mean? Nothing like that to scare away a 27-year-old guy.”</p><p>In 2016, she revealed that she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage the year prior</a>, shortly before heading on stage to perform.</p><p>“It’s the angriest performance that I’ve ever done in my life. That was the moment of my life where I thought to myself, ‘I don’t feel like a f–king human being anymore,'” Hasley told Rolling Stone. “This thing, this music, Halsey, whatever it is that I’m doing, took precedence and priority over every decision that I made regarding this entire situation from the moment I found out until the moment it went wrong. I walked offstage and went into the parking lot and just start throwing up.”</p><p>The “Closer” singer has been open about her dating life in the past and revealed in 2019 that she “<a href=#>stopped dating musicians</a>” for the time being.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I want everyone to be the best version of themselves so much that I sometimes don’t focus on making me the best version of myself,” she <a href=#>told Apple Music</a> in January 2020. “I do everything in my power to help them succeed. And then, at some point, I’m like where do I fit in this box.”</p><p>Scroll through for Halsey’s full dating history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktaK40p6wrGWUlsGqusZmn6KrpKS%2FunnEr5inZaCawaa%2B0maYpZ2mYq66sMinZKanopp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-styles-goes-boating-with-james-corden-and-friends-in-italy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Styles Goes Boating With James Corden and Friends in Italy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gigi-hadid-bathroom-4-million-home.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gigi Hadid Reveals Glimpse Of Colorful Room In $4 Million Home</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
