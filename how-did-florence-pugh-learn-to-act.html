She came from a family of actors; of her four siblings, one was in Game of Thrones and her sister is a stage actor.</p><p>When she was a child, she played a "northern Mary" in a nativity play and got the audience howling, which sold her on the profession.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Florence Pugh And Olivia Wilde?</a></span></p><p>It seems she knew she would be an actress, and when she was in high school, Florence pushed back when her school wasn't supportive of her acting dreams. Not only that, but they actively disapproved of her taking an acting gig at that time, despite drama being "the only thing" Florence says she was ever good at.</p><p>It didn't deter her; Florence's first film, The Falling, came out when she was 17.</p><p>However, Florence never had formal training as an actress, which left her worried that she would eventually be 'found out' as a fake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=florence-pugh-never-had-formal-acting-training>Florence Pugh Never Had Formal Acting Training</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/florence-pugh-at-the-london-premiere-of-oppenheimer.jpg><p>Though Florence now has many accolades for her acting under her belt, she struggled internally as a then-new actress. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with BBC</a>, which confirmed that Pugh never took any acting classes and simply went from high school to films, Pugh admitted that her first big movie (with big names) was "absolutely terrifying."</p><p>She knew how tough it could be, saying of her brother, "I remember watching him for years so, by the time I stepped up, I kind of knew the harsh reality of how things worked."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Pugh noted in one interview, her sister, the stage actress, "is the only one who actually studied, so she’s the one with all the knowledge." Not having any education as an actress made Pugh fearful that people would decide she didn't know what she was doing, and she would get fired from the projects she landed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Florence Pugh Decided To Shave Her Head</a></span></p><p>In one scenario, all the actors showed up to a table read with notes all over their scripts, and Pugh's had none. She admitted "It’s very easy to suddenly feel like you’re not supposed to be there," but focused on "constantly learning" from everyone she worked with.</p><p>Yet in her first film, she explained that the director wouldn't let anyone watch themselves on film. Instead, they had to act without knowing what they looked like, something that Florence noted helped her to get outside of her head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Working with Emma Thompson and being around "loud female wisdom all day" also helped Florence develop her education in the industry, she explained, even though every new role still gave her nerves.</p><p>As far as being scared to meet big-name celebrities, in that early project, it was Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins. Later, Florence would admit to being "so scared" to meet Meryl Streep (for Little Women), but by the time she appeared in Midsommar, Pugh was the critics' favorite.</p><h2 id=in-2019-florence-pugh-got-her-big-break>In 2019, Florence Pugh Got Her Big Break</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/untitled-5.jpg><p>For Florence Pugh, 2019 was the year; she had three big roles in three separate projects, Pretty Women being one of them. Her performances earned rave reviews, and it seemed that all the worries Florence had about being seen as a 'fake' were a non-issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, there were complaints from fans about Florence's relationship with Zach Braff, who was much older than her; some have suggested that <a href=#>her breakup was even a good thing for her career</a>. There has also been criticism of Pugh's accent, and even <a href=#>accusations that she fakes it</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'</a></span></p><p>None of that matters at this point, though; Florence continues to land big roles, charm the pants off critics, and stay true to herself while molding herself into characters that continue to enchant audiences.</p><p>Being connected to Don't Worry Darling—with all the drama behind the scenes—also helped propel Florence Pugh into fans' consciousness. Amid the reported drama, Florence remained silent, even missing red-carpet appearances, which got the gossip mill going.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Florence was simply busy with other projects, showing she's capable of keeping things professional even as it all falls down around her.</p><p>But it might not be film that ultimately has her heart; in one interview, Pugh said she missed singing, and though she got to perform some songs on screen, she's planning to release an album at some point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecWlpqudnpiybrzUoJ9mpJWWv69506hkmpukZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bon-jovi-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bon Jovi Net Worth How Much is Bon Jovi Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ayva-severy-to-know-everything-about-the-young-actress.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ayva Severy: To Know Everything About The Young Actress</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
