The pair was together from 2008 until 2009, so it was short-lived but it was also very dramatic. Let's take a look at their love story.</p><h2 id=good-friends>Good Friends</h2><p>Lohan has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated a lot of guys away from the public eye</a>&nbsp;but when she was with Samantha Ronson, they were definitely in the limelight, as they weren't hiding their romance.</p><p>Sometimes a friendship will turn into a romance, and other times, both people will feel that they're better off in a platonic relationship than anything else. It sounds like that might have happened between Lindsay Lohan and her ex-girlfriend.</p><p>According to the actress, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Roson were good friends</a>.&nbsp;People.com&nbsp;says that Lohan was a guest on&nbsp;The Howard Stern Show&nbsp;in 2019 and she said, “I talk about that on the show," meaning her MTV&nbsp;reality series&nbsp;Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club. The actress continued,&nbsp;“We’re friends. We were more friends than anything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan Reveals The Key To Switching Between Characters In ‘The Parent Trap’</a></span></p><h2 id=ronson-and-lohan-s-love-story>Ronson And Lohan's Love Story</h2><p>Besides saying that they were better off as friends, Lohan has also used the word "toxic" to describe the way that things were between her and her ex-girlfriend. According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, Lohan said back in 2012, "I needed to love myself before I could be with anyone. And I was going through a lot. Two toxic people cannot be together. End of story.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Intomore.com, Lohan called the love story between her and Ronson "serious" in 2012 and said they were "in love." A few years before, in 2008, she said she wasn't interested in classifying herself. She said, “I don’t want to classify myself. First of all, you never know what’s going to happen tomorrow, in a month, a year from now, five years from now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ranker.com&nbsp;says that Lohan proudly said she was with Ronson. She was quoted saying, "I was bold enough to say, 'Yeah, I like a girl. And?'"</p><p>It definitely sounds like the stars had quite a rocky time together, and even after they broke up, it continued. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lohan lived&nbsp;right next to Ronson</a> once they had split up. According to&nbsp;Ranker.com, after the couple went their separate ways&nbsp;in April 2009, Lohan started living in a home right next to her ex-girlfriend once she was finished with rehab.&nbsp;As a source explained, “Samantha walked out of the building next door. She was shaking her head and looking disgusted. She kept saying, ‘I didn't plan it this way.’”</p><p>It also sounds like the pressures of fame might have made it tough for Lohan and Ronson to maintain their relationship. When she was interviewed by&nbsp;Harper's Bazaar&nbsp;in 2008, Lohan talked around the romance without really getting too specific, but what she did say was pretty telling. Lohan said, "I feel like it jinxes it. It's hard. The second I start talking about whomever I'm seeing, a month or two later it's failed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress continued, "I think it's pretty obvious who I'm seeing. I think it's no shock to anyone that it's been going on for quite some time. ... She's a wonderful person and I love her very much."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Aaron Carter’s Relationship With Hilary Duff (And Lindsay Lohan)</a></span></p><h2 id=lohan-s-exes>Lohan's Exes</h2><p>Lindsay Lohan has definitely had a fairly active love life over the years, and fans of the actress will recall that she has been linked to many famous people.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, in 2016 Lohan was engaged to&nbsp;Egor Tarabasov but that didn't end up going anywhere.
