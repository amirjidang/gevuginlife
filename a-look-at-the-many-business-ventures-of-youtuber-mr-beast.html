According to the data provided by the YouTube analytics provider SocialBlade, Mr. Beast brings in between $3 to 5 million every single month as of the year 2022. On the other hand, his total net worth is a mystery because he funnels some of his earnings back into developing new ventures.</p><p>In addition to YouTube, he is involved in the investment of other businesses.

According to the challenge, the last participant to withdraw their finger from the phone screen wins $25,000 in the game. 1.1 million people downloaded the game and is among <a href=#>the most used app</a>. When it had been going on for three hours, there were still 400,000 people participating in the game.</p><p>Four users shared $20,000 in prize money after spending more than 70 hours glued to the app. The game was so popular that a sequel titled "Finger on the App 2" was initially slated to appear in December 2020. However, the game was pushed to February and then further delayed until March 2021 due to a deluge of downloads, forcing the game to break and prompting its producers to rebuild its servers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mrbeast-burger>MrBeast Burger</h2><p>Donaldson then went on to open a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger</a> in December 2020. MrBeast Burger's expansion plans have been publicized since its inception. Donohue acknowledged the issue and said that efforts were underway to increase the number of outlets to double or perhaps triple the number of stations. Toronto, Edmonton, and Calgary were the first Canadian locations to open in early February, with Vancouver, Halifax, and Winnipeg following shortly after. Five locations in the United Kingdom (UK) opened in early May.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It began operations in December 2020 with 300 locations in the United States, but since then, it has grown to 1000 locations around North America, Europe, and other parts of the world. Although it is not a <a href=#>high end burger joint</a>, through the sale of MrBeast Burger, MrBeast is turning a profit of $24,000 daily, which amounts to an astounding $720,000 every month. In July 2022, Donaldson announced that Beast Burger had distributed more than $1,000,000 in revenue to restaurants all around the United States.</p><h2 id=feastables>Feastables</h2><p>Jimmy made an announcement regarding the creation of his very own chocolate bar brand in the Beast Reacts video titled Inside an Ice Cream Factory! but for the following few months, he refrained from providing any further details regarding<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> this endeavor until its official release</a>. MrBeast Bars were established in January 2022 by Donaldson as a novel food company named Feastables, and the company's first product was a line of chocolate bars. Original, almond & quinoa crunch were the three flavors available at launch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The introduction was accompanied by a $1 million sweepstakes, with ten grand prize winners receiving an opportunity to compete in a future video for a chocolate factory. A video of a cake judged by Gordon Ramsay and $500,000 in cash was released in June 2022. To provide rewards for the contest, Feastables <a href=#>has decided to work together </a>with Turtle Beach and Roccat on February 2nd, 2022.Since it opened its doors in January, the company has generated more than $10 million in revenue from sales.</p><h2 id=backbone>Backbone</h2><p>Among Donaldson's investments is the digital start-up Backbone, which creates the Backbone One controller, which makes cellphones more like Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, which gives users content production and social features. He became a long-term investor in the financial technology business Current in April 2021.
