She then married music executive Robert Ellis Siberstein and had two more daughters. Her second marriage to shipping magnate Arne Naess Jr. produced two sons.</p><p>The matriarch of five, can now boast a family full of successful careers from musicians to actresses.

In the early 1980’s the singer left Motown and signed a $20 million contract with RCA Records, the most <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">expensive recording deal</a> in history according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. She’s also acted in a number of films, earning a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination for her turn in 1972’s Lady Sing the Blues. Despite her personal success, Ross would tell you, it was her family that always took top place in her heart.</p><h2 id=rhonda-ross-kendrick-ndash-20-million>Rhonda Ross Kendrick – $20 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The oldest child of Diana Ross and the only child she had with Gordy, has found success in both music and television. She’s best known for her role in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">soap opera</a> Another World and was nominated for an Emmy in 1998. Kendrick released two albums in 2002 and 2016 and it’s not uncommon to see her sharing the stage with her mother. Though the singer was raised by her adoptive father, Silberstein, she discovered Gordy was her father at the age of 13.</p><h2 id=tracee-ellis-ross-ndash-16-million>Tracee Ellis Ross – $ 16 Million</h2><p>The second eldest daughter of Ross and first child of Silberstein, Tracee has earned her stardom through lead roles in television sitcoms like Girlfriends and Black-ish. She earned eight <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">NAACP</a> Image Award nominations for her role in Girlfriends and won in 2007 and 2009 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Tracee has worked on films alongside Tyler Perry, Queen Latifah and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Diane Keaton</a>. Most recently, she launched a podcast, “I Am America”, shining a light on everyday people that reach out with kindness and humanity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Family Trees: 8 Ancestral Surprises</a></span></p><h2 id=chudney-ross-ndash-5-million>Chudney Ross – $5 Million</h2><p>The third and final daughter of Diana and second daughter of Silberstein, Chudney Ross is perhaps the one sibling that has taken a different road. She grew up in the entertainment industry, however, after graduating from Georgetown University, Chudney <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">became a teacher </a>with AmeriCorps’ teaching program in Wahisngton D.C. With a passion for children, the youngest Ross daughter has published a children’s book series “Bean’s Books” and launched Books and Cookies, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">a bookstore</a> and bakery in one along with an enrichment center to encourage literacy at a young age.</p><h2 id=ross-arne-naess-ndash-800-000>Ross Arne Naess – $800,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His mother married businessman Arne Naess in 1986 and gave birth to her oldest son a year later. Naess owns a popular <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hollywood nightclub</a>, The Warick, he’s a successful photographer and tends to enjoy time behind the camera instead of in front of it. He produced the 2014 film Acid Girls but above all, Naess is known for his outgoing and adventurous personality, following in his father’s footsteps.</p><h2 id=evan-ross-ndash-25-million>Evan Ross – $25 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The baby of the family has more than 30 acting credits to his name, including The Hungar Games alongside <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence </a>and has appeared in music videos among the likes of Lionel Richie and The Notorious B.I.G. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.</a>, most recently, Evan starred in 2021’s The United States vs. Billie Holiday and She Ball. Ross has always been involved in the music industry. His debut album was released in 2011 and he has since recorded duo’s with his wife, Ashlee Simpson.</p><h2 id=ashlee-simpson-ndash-11-million>Ashlee Simpson – $11 Million</h2><p>She married into the Ross family, however, Simpson was already a star in her own right. The singer and actress has released three albums with songs like “Pieces of Me” and “Boyfriend”. She’s also had <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">success as a television actress</a> on 7th Heaven and a regular role on CW’s Melrose Place revival. Simpson has one child with ex-husband Pete Wentz, front man for the rock band Fall Out Boy and two more children with Ross. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">With older sister Jessica Simpson’s fame</a> and her own successful career, it’s unlikely Simpson is phased by the stardom highlighting the Ross family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-jacksons>The Jacksons</h2><p>While Diana Ross isn’t exactly related to the Jackson family, their history goes back to childhood. Ross met <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson</a> when she was performing with the Supremes and he was a nine-year-old just being discovered with the original band, the Jackson 5. The connections continue through their lives, with Michael’s brother, Jermaine marrying Berry Gordy’s daughter Hazel in 1973. Their three children would be the half siblings of Ross’ oldest daughter Rhonda. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, Jackson left direction in his will, if his mother was unable to care for his children, he wanted the children to be cared for by his mentor and idol, Ross.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">8 Famous Relatives On The Big Screen</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMq6CcoJWowW65xKaZnqqjYrynedOhnGaqn6jAbrLApqClsV2nrq%2B3xJ1km7Fdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./timothe-chalamet-had-to-deal-with-three-of-his-exgirlfriends-attending-the-met-gala.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Timothe Chalamet Had To Deal With Three Of His Ex-Girlfriends Attending The Met Gala</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-morris-murder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Mysterious Disappearance And Discovery Of Christina Morris</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
