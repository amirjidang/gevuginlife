On this week’s Collector’s Corner we take a look at the newest WWE Bleacher Creatures consisting of:</p><ul><li>Becky Lynch</li><li>AJ Styles</li><li>Seth Rollins</li><li>Macho Man Randy Savage</li><li>Rey Mysterio</li><li>Elias</li><li>Finn Bálor</li></ul><p>You can currently get these on the Bleacher Creature <a href=# rel=noopener>website</a> and possibly on WWE Shop in the future as they’ve had past ones. Each of these comes in a plastic bag to protect them in transit. I’ve seen them come with cardboard stands as well at other retailers so it may vary which version you get.</p><h4>Becky Lynch</h4><p>Becky features her “The Man” attire and sports her braided orange hair. The braid is just a design in her hair versus actually being an extra piece of fabric. Overall she looks pretty nice and the likeness isn’t too bad for a plush version. I’m sure this will be one of the more sought after ones in the set as well.</p><h4>AJ Styles</h4><p>AJ I feel looks the best in the set as it honestly looks just like him in plush form. Pretty impressive as the likenesses can be such a hit or miss with these being they’re caricatures. He’s sporting his blue and black attire, which looks good. He has several logos but not all of course as these aren’t super detailed. Overall, I think he looks the best and recommend him. I know he has some other versions but the blue is a nice touch.</p><h4>Seth Rollins</h4><p>Rollins looks pretty good. This one is wearing one of his latest t-shirts while others they’ve released before I believe were in his entrance attire. The likeness is pretty good for him, too and what better that he comes in the same set as Becky as if you haven’t heard enough about their relationship! Rollins is a great addition to any Rollins collector’s collection. He’s not my favorite in the set but he still looks decent.</p><h4>Macho Man</h4><p>Macho is my favorite in the set. His likeness is just okay but the attire and design of it overall are really nice. I love how colorful it is and the fact he has his hat and tassels on his arms. Just really fun to go with all the current Macho Man product surfacing as of late. He also has bushy hair on the back of his head, which is cool, plus he even has his shades on. Overall, he’s a great piece for anybody who loves collecting the legends and especially Macho Man memorabilia. Oh yeah!</p><h4>Rey Mysterio</h4><p>Rey is probably my second favorite of the set. He, too, is very colorful and has a lot of detail on him compared to several of the others, which makes him really stand out. I love how they made his mask feel as if he is actually wearing a mask than just printing it onto his head. The mask actually flaps near his mouth to help create that illusion. I wish he wasn’t wearing a shirt so you could see all of his tattoos but perhaps they did that on purpose to avoid that. Regardless, his is really cool looking.</p><p>Who wants to walk with Elias? This one is pretty cool. His likeness is just ok but I love they made a separate felt-like piece for his guitar to create the illusion it’s really on his back. Unfortunately his scarf and bandana gauntlets are just printed on that being separate pieces of fabric to create the illusion he’s really wearing them. I’d have preferred they do it that way but regardless it looks pretty good. He even has his ponytail on his head, which is a nice touch at least. Overall, it’s not bad, but not my favorite with the execution but it’s still nice for any Elias fan.</p><h4>Finn Bálor</h4><p>Finn is really nice and probably my third favorite in the set. I love how they did his “leather” jacket as it looks like he’s really wearing one. Thankfully it’s a different material, too, that helps create the leather look. It has the Bálor Club logos on the back of his jacket and on his trunks as well, which is nice. They also layered his hair to make his haircut look more realistic, which is also a nice touch. I believe they made him in his black attire before but this blue one is nice as it pops more. Overall, this is a really cool collectible for any Bálor fan. Hopefully they’ll do a demon one soon, too.</p><p></p><h4>Overall</h4><p>Overall I like this batch. It’s pretty nice as I feel they stepped up their game a bit with these. There’s definitely more detail on some and the likenesses have improved a little bit as well. I highly recommend Macho, Rey and Bálor if you’re a fan of them. Macho is my main favorite as who doesn’t love the Macho Man? Get them while you can on <a href=# rel=noopener>BleacherCreatures.com</a> or see if they surface elsewhere eventually. There are many other ones you can get as well on their website and WWE Shop.</p><h2 class=xe-gallery__title>WWE Bleacher Creatures: Lynch, AJ, Elias, Bálor, Macho, Rollins, Rey</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBrZ2pqY2KwsLjLnpqtp6KoeqS70aecq2WnrLJursuemJyglad6pL7EmquuqpWoeqOxwqSwZpmaYr%2BwuMuipaxlnZawqbuMprCsrJWntrB5xKWgmqtdl66tu9Fmp6GnpKTA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dess-dior-bio-age-height-futures-girlfriend-children-parents-rapper-and-net-worth-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dess Dior Bio, Age, Height, Futures Girlfriend, Children, Parents, Rapper and Net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charmed-cast-dont-call-our-show-a-rip-off.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charmed Cast: Dont Call Our Show a Rip-Off</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
