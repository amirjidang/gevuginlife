While Nene Leakes is mostly known for her role on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta", the reality star managed to go from reality television to the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she didn't hold a major role on the FOX show, Nene Leakes managed to remain on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Glee" </a>scene for a whopping 4 seasons and did so spectacularly. It's safe to say Nene gets herself in trouble with those she works with at times, however, it appears as if her relationship with Ryan Murphy has not only stood the test of time but landed Nene on not one but two of his shows! Here is everything we know about&nbsp;how Ryan Murphy felt about Nene's role on "Glee"!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumours Nene Leakes Wishes Would Disappear</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-murphy-reached-out-to-nene-leakes>Ryan Murphy Reached Out To Nene Leakes</h2><p>When the time came to write a character that could go head to head with "Glee's" Sue Sylvester, played by the talented Jane Lynch, there was only one person that Ryan Murphy could think of for the role and that was none other than Nene Leakes. The "Real Housewives" legend is known for being strong-willed, independent and someone who isn't afraid to speak her mind, which is the perfect match for Sue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Nene's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> interview with Larry King</a>, the reality star revealed that Ryan Murphy was the one who reached out to Nene first. The star claimed that she received a phone call from a man named Ryan Murphy, hinting at the fact that she had no idea who he was at the time. After speaking to her manager about the phone call, it was confirmed that Ryan Murphy did, in fact, call Nene and wanted her on the show for not one, but four seasons!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glee's Top 15 Guest Appearances Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=she-instantly-became-his-muse>She Instantly Became His Muse</h2><p>While Nene Leakes only held a recurring role between 2012-2015, she instantly became a favourite of Ryan Murphy's, so much that he asked her to be on another one of his shows, "The New Normal". Murphy has made his love for Nene Leakes very known and the two remain extremely close to this very day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan, who loves to surround himself with strong women, had Nene Leakes at his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony</a> back in 2018. So, when it comes to what Ryan thinks about Nene and her role on "Glee", it's safe to say that he loved every single bit of it and we did too! While there are no plans for Nene to appear on any of Ryan Murphy's current shows, we are certain that the two will come up with a fun idea any day now.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Seasons Of "Glee": Here Is What Fans Never Found Out&nbsp;</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKuxkaN6rsHRqZ%2ByZZiWsW7AzmaqmrFdlq%2BwwdNmpZ6mlWK5pq3Knqpmn5yasm6%2BzqWcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-travel-with-ozempic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to travel with ozempic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./herbert-allen-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Herbert Allen Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
