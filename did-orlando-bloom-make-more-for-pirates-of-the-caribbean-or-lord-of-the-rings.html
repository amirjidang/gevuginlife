Franchise like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> have all shelled out top dollar for their biggest stars, making any franchise role incredibly desirable for the world’s top performers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Orlando Bloom has been a monumental success in the movie industry, and he has done this by landing primary roles in multiple franchises. This is incredibly rare to pull off, and it has people wondering about the type of money that he has made along the way.</p><p>Let’s see which major franchise paid Orlando Bloom the most!</p><h2 id=he-got-175-000-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy>He Got $175,000 For The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</h2><p>To get things started, we should first shine a light on the initial franchise that got the ball rolling for Orlando Bloom’s Hollywood journey. Landing the role of Legolas wound up being a huge win for the performer thanks to the success of the trilogy, but surprisingly, the salary that Bloom was given isn’t quite what some would expect.</p><p>For the trilogy of films, Orlando Bloom was paid a mere $175,000. Yes, you read that correctly. To be fair, there were a lot of primary characters taking part in the film and it was all filmed at one time, meaning that the studio was taking a huge gamble with the project. Nevertheless, only getting $175,000 for a trilogy of films would never fly in this day and age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a>, Bloom would say, “Nothing, I got nothing. $175 grand...Listen, greatest gift of my life. Are you kidding me? I'd do it again for half the money.&nbsp;I think there was a little bump when the movies came out...It was like a little bump, but it was nice.”</p><p>It’s nice to hear that there was some money on the backend, but based on the way that Bloom phrased it, there was not a whole lot that came his way.</p><p>At the box office, the&nbsp;Lord of the Rings movies would go on to gross billions of dollars, and their success opened the door for Bloom to negotiate higher pay for other projects.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom’s $14.2 Million Ocean View Montecito Home</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-paid-over-11-million-for-each-pirates-sequel>He Was Paid Over $11 Million For Each Pirates Sequel</h2><p>In 2003,&nbsp;The Return of the King rounded out the&nbsp;Lord of the Rings trilogy at the box office, closing the door on what was a massive cinematic achievement. Interestingly, that same year,&nbsp;Curse of the Black Pearl would debut at the box office, kicking off another huge franchise of films for Bloom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the previews for the film looked great, no one knew what to expect when it hit the box office. After all, the film was based on a Disneyland ride, and the interest in pirate content in the 21st century was no guarantee. Nevertheless,&nbsp;Curse of the Black Pearl&nbsp;was a huge hit that wound up being profitable for all involved.</p><p>It’s has been reported that for the next two films in the franchise,&nbsp;Dead Man’s Chest and&nbsp;At World’s End, Orlando Bloom was paid over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$11 million</a> for each film. That is a huge jump in pay for the performer, and the string of successful films just kept on rolling for Bloom during that time.</p><p>Once again, Bloom was featured in movies that grossed billions of dollars during their time at the box office, but this time, his paychecks reflected that. It should also be noted that Bloom appeared in&nbsp;Dead Men Tell No Tales, but his salary, much like his salary with&nbsp;Curse of the Black Pearl, is unknown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While these franchises were his biggest triumphs, Bloom continued to land roles in other prominent films. Years after the original trilogy, the actor would once again find himself heading back to Middle Earth. Only this time, he made sure to make some more money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Katy Perry’s Motherhood Journey</a></span></p><h2 id=the-hobbit-franchise-ups-his-pay>The Hobbit Franchise Ups His Pay</h2><p>When&nbsp;The Hobbit franchise was announced, there was a lot of hype around the films. After all, the original trilogy was a huge accomplishment, and these movies had so much potential to make a mint at the box office.</p><p>Orlando Bloom stepped back into the saddle to reprise the role of Legolas, and people were ready to see their favorite Elf back in action. Thankfully, Bloom’s pay would increase for these movies.</p><p>According to&nbsp;CelebGag, Bloom was able to net himself over $21 million for his time in the&nbsp;Hobbit&nbsp;trilogy. Those films would go on to make a fortune at the box office, and while they are not as celebrated as the original trilogy, they still made a sizable impact with fans around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of Taking Selfies In Bed</a></span></p><p>Orlando Bloom has done quite well for himself in Hollywood, but when looking at the whole picture, his time on the high seas was more lucrative than his time in Middle Earth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Keep Their Kids Hidden From The Public</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpL%2Btrc2dpmaanKS8rnnMmqKeZZ2kv6Z5xaipZqiZp661sdJmpp9lpJ2ybq%2FAq6CbmpWWu2670WajqKqUYrynedOhnGaqmaO0tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./duncan-bannatyne-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Duncan Bannatyne Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chloe-randolphs-story-the-young-mothers-horrifying-murder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chloe Randolphs story The young mothers horrifying murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
