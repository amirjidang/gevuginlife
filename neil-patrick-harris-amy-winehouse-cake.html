style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Neil Patrick Harris Amy Winehouse cake at his Halloween party was deemed in bad taste.</p><p>The cake, featuring a design referencing Amy Winehouse, drew criticism for its insensitivity towards the late singer and her struggles.</p><p>Neil Patrick Harris, the popular actor, has recently come under fire for offering an Amy Winehouse-themed meat platter at his Halloween party back in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress died of alcohol poisoning a few months earlier, making his choice of plating an instance of bad taste that earned widespread criticism.</p><p>Eleven years after the party, the actor again faced backlash due to a resurrection of the conversation around the picture of the macabre platter that did the rounds after the party.</p><p>Justin Mikita, married to Jesse Tyler Ferguson, posted the picture of the platter in a now-deleted tweet with the caption, <strong>“Looking good.”</strong></p><p>Dubbed the ‘Amy Weinstein cake’ by some people, the platter was, in actuality, a meat platter consisting of beef ribs, pulled pork, and chicken sausage in a spicy BBQ sauce.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the meat dish was a handwritten sign that said “Corpse of Amy Winehouse,” which understandably exacerbated the situation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A scathing attack on Neil Patrick Harris</h2><p>Social media watchdogs have launched a scathing attack on Neil Patrick Harris following the reemergence of a photo from 11 years ago, reigniting shock and outrage among fans.</p><p>The image, taken during Harris’ 2011 Halloween party, showcased a dish labeled “The Corpse of Amy Winehouse,” as reported by <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The now-deleted photo, originally posted by Justin Mikita, featured a representation of Winehouse that was bloodied and disfigured.</p><p>Amy Winehouse, the acclaimed “Rehab” singer, tragically passed away just three months before Halloween at 27.</p><p>Writer Ashley Reed took to Twitter on Tuesday to discuss the ill-judged creation served at the party hosted by the 48-year-old star of “How I Met Your Mother.” Reed’s tweet quickly went viral, drawing attention to the offensive Amy Winehouse cake.</p><p>“I am appalled by the number of adults over 25 who are only now discovering the repugnant Amy Winehouse cake served by Neil Patrick Harris,” read the tweet from Reed, who has since made her account private.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Aftermath</h2><p>The controversy surrounding the Neil Patrick Harris Amy Winehouse cake reignited discussions about the appropriate ways to honor and remember public figures.</p><p>Given the controversial nature of the dish at the time, it is understandable that the actor faced massive backlash and criticism from the public, who accused Harris of showing no remorse or empathy towards Winehouse’s tragic death.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, in May 2022, when the photo of the meat platter resurfaced on Twitter, Harris issued an apology while speaking to Entertainment Weekly.</p><p>In the statement, Harris said, <strong>“It was regrettable then, and it remains regrettable now. Amy Winehouse was a once-in-a-generation talent, and I’m sorry for any hurt this image caused.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This apology comes more than a decade after the event, but it shows the actor is aware of how his actions may have perpetuated the negative perception of the public’s beloved Winehouse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Backlash</h2><p>The decision by Harris to offer an Amy Winehouse-themed dish after her untimely passing struck many fans as being incredibly insensitive and disrespectful.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans thought the choice of name and the sign accompanying the dish was in poor taste and showed very little consideration for Winehouse as a person.</p><p>Amy Winehouse was an icon of the music industry before her untimely death, and her struggles with drug addiction and other mental health issues were well-known to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the media’s treatment of her was often insensitive, with tabloids exploiting her troubles instead of offering empathy.</p><p>Neil Patrick Harris’ decision to serve a “Corpse of Amy Winehouse” platter has thus stirred up some of the past emotions and feelings of hurt experienced by many who loved and admired Amy Winehouse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Neil Patrick Harris’ decision to serve an Amy Winehouse-themed dish continues to spark discussions on insensitivity and the need for empathy towards famous personalities’ passing on.&nbsp;</p><p>While it remains to be seen if he was aware of his inappropriate decision, his belated apology shows some semblance of remorse and empathy for Winehouse and those who loved her.</p><p>It is important to consider the impact of one’s actions, whether as an individual or a celebrity and how these actions can hurt those who admire or love the late icon.&nbsp;</p><p>It is necessary to mourn a person’s loss with respectful silence, humility, and empathy, as opposed to humor or disrespect.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC6xKKjZqiRqb%2Bqr8pmn5qqop7Abq3MsmSwoZ6atbDB0p5knJmbmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./new-retailers-coming-to-south-ends-atherton-mill.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>New retailers coming to South End's Atherton Mill WSOC TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./metro-boomin-tiktok-songs-success-platform-1234847159.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Metro Boomin Speaks On &amp;quot;Soulless&amp;quot; Songs On TikTok Platform</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
