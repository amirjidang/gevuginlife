This fall, she can add a new job title to her resume: published author.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Confused As Details Of Jennifer Lawrence And Emily Ratajkowski Feud Emerge</a></span></p><p>During the 2020 quarantine,<a href=#> it was reported that Ratajkowski was working on a book of essays</a> about her life, and that book – titled My Body – finally came out this fall. <a href=#>She has long been known to be an avid reader</a>, so it's not totally surprising that she decided to take a stab at writing a book. That being said, there aren't too many famous models who are also talented writers, so this book has been the subject of quite a lot of press since it's release. The media has particularly focused on the several stories in the book about her childhood, which has got fans wondeing just how well Emily Ratajkowski really gets along with her family. Here is what we know about her relationship with her mother, her father, her husband, and even her new baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-an-only-child><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Is An Only Child</span></h2><p>Emily Ratajkowski was born to parents John David Ratajkowski and Kathleen Anne Balgley in 1991. She does not have any brothers or sisters. Unfortunately, having her parents' undivided attention was not always a good thing for Ratajkowski growing up . According to her new book Ratajkowski's parents had a difficult marriage and were often fighting with each other. Even worse, they were often involving young Emily in their fights, and she says she often felt like she was responsible for keeping them together.</p><h2 id=her-parents-relied-on-her-after-their-fights><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Parents Relied On Her After Their Fights</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In My Body, Ratajkowski describes that after her parents would have a fight, one of them would always come to her to talk about it, either to "plead their case or to air their grievances." She says she was always a good listener, but that after the fact these conversations would always make her feel uneasy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Robin Thicke 'Canceled' After Emily Ratajkowski Claims He Groped Her On Set Of 'Blurred Lines'</a></span></p><h2 id=her-mother-gave-her-a-complicated-relationship-with-beauty><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Mother Gave Her A Complicated Relationship With Beauty</span></h2><p>Emily Ratajkowski began modelling professionally in her teenage years, so clearly her looks have always been important to her. However, she also feels like she has a very complicated relationship to her own appearance, which is completely understandable for someone who has been sexualized by the media from such a young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ratajkowski first started modelling, her proud mother put <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"a sexy photo of Ratajkowski on the kitchen counter,"</a> which made Ratajkowski feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. That story is emblematic of how her mother always places too much emphasis on Emily's looks and not enough on her other qualities.</p><h2 id=her-father-also-cared-a-lot-about-her-looks><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Her Father Also Cared A Lot About Her Looks</span></h2><p>While she focuses on her mother when it comes to the topic of beauty, Emily Ratajkowski believes her father also contributed to her strange relationship to appearances. She wrote in her book that "it seemed important to them both... that their daughter be perceived as beautiful." In the same book, she also tells a story about when, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"her father, a high school art teacher, had proudly displayed her modelling “comp” card, which included her headshots and measurements, in his classroom."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Emily Ratajkowski And Amy Schumer's Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=she-married-her-husband-sebastian-bear-mcclard-after-only-a-few-weeks><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Married Her Husband Sebastian Bear-McClard After Only A Few Weeks</span></h2><p>From an outsider's perspective, it definitel seems like Emily Ratajkowski has a strong and healthy relationship with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While some might say that their decision to get married at a courthouse after only a few weeks of dating was rash</a>, the couple has clearly proved their doubters wrong.

After all she did FaceTime with them immediately afterwards to share the good news. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she told the story of how she finally informed her parents <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I had to FaceTime to my parents and by then I had several glasses of champagne.

By all accounts, she is a loving and hardworking mother to little Sylvester. That being said, she has faced her fair share of criticism from those who have problems with her mothering skills. On one occasion, <a href=#>several fans called her out for the unsafe way she seemed to be holding her baby in an Instagram post</a>.
