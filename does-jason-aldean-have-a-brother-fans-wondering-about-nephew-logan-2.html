Born on February 28, 1977, in Macon, Georgia, the 45-year-old was given Jason Aldine Williams as his birth name, which he later changed to Aldean.</p><p>But, his childhood was not as fancy as everybody imagined. His parents split when he was three, and Aldean lived with his mother. People are wondering whether the singer has a brother.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-jason-aldean-have-a-brother></span>Does Jason Aldean Have A Brother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jason Aldean does not have a biological brother, but he has two step-brothers from his father, who left his mother when Jason was three years old.</p><p>His mother mainly reared him in Macon, Georgia, where his parents had separated. He attended a secondary school called Windsor Academy while residing in Macon, Georgia.</p><p>He has three siblings; one sister and two step brothers. One of his brothers is named Jared, while the other is named Tombo. There has been barely any information available about Jared. But his other half-brother, Tombo, is quite interesting.</p><p>Tombo is a hunter. He often shows up on the “Buck Commander” youtube channel. The channel includes various videos, including deer hunting and multiple types of videos. On the hunting grounds, Jason ran upon his long-lost brother. Before chatting and getting along, they were unaware of their relationships, but as soon as their shared childhood memories began to flow, they learned they were step-brothers.</p><p>Tombo said, “My mom remarried and was married to his dad he looks at his wife and he said this is my brother and right then everybody just blew up.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-jason-aldean-nephew-logan-and-sister-kasi-rosa-wicks></span>Meet Jason Aldean, Nephew Logan And Sister Kasi Rosa Wicks<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jason Aldean has a famous nephew named Logan Crosby. He is a singer and a participant in the new ABC show Claim to Fame.</p><p>The budding singer publishes humorous videos and song samples on his TikTok profile, where he has amassed almost 90K followers.

Wicks and Williams were married in a church in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in 2019. When the newlyweds cut the cake, everyone could watch the fireworks.</p><p>Netizens also wonder if Aldean is related to&nbsp;Chuck Wicks. It turns out that Kasi is a younger sister of Aldean. Chuck is now Aldean’s brother-in-law as a result of their marriage. Of course, Aldean attended Williams and Wicks’ wedding as one of the guests.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jason-aldean-children-%e2%80%93-sons-and-daughters-from-2-marriages></span>Jason Aldean Children – Sons And Daughters From 2 Marriages<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jason Aldean has two children with his first wife, Jessica Ann Ussery.
