But it’s good. It’s really good.”</p><p>Travis, 34, encouraged Jason to stash the present “wherever you hid your [Super Bowl] ring.” (Fans who’ve seen the Prime Video documentary Kelce watched Jason struggle to remember where he put his ring from the Philadelphia Eagles’ 2017 Super Bowl victory.)</p><p>While she may have gotten a quick glimpse, Jason ensured that Kylie “doesn’t know fully how cool” the gift really is. “I’m pretty excited,” he said.</p><p>The couple have been married since 2018 and share daughters <a href=#>Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 2, and Bennett, 8 months</a>. Jason noted that his little girls are easily impressed around the holidays. “Get [something with] Dino Ranch and Bluey and they’ll be like, ‘Ahhh!'” he told Travis, referring to Disney Junior characters.</p><p>Following years of recognition in the NFL, the Kelce family has been thrust even further into the spotlight this year thanks to their historic Super Bowl showdown in February and Travis’ budding romance with <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>. While Jason has been vocal about his brother’s relationship, Kylie has yet to publicly share her thoughts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Kelce-Is-Pretty-Sure-Wife-Kylie-Kelce-Has-Already-Seen-Her-Christmas-Present-15-Times-01.jpg><p>Swift, 31, wasn’t there to see Travis and Jason <a href=#>face off against one another</a> when the Kansas City Chiefs played the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, November 20, due to a rescheduled Eras Tour concert in South America. Kylie, meanwhile, <a href=#>took her seat in the stadium</a> with fellow Eagles fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m a stands girl,” she noted on Sunday, November 19, while speaking to reporters at her Kansas City field hockey clinic. “I love sitting in the stands, cheering with the fans even if it’s in an opposing team’s stadium.”</p><p>Kylie acknowledged that the Kansas City community has welcomed the Kelce family with open arms, but that kindness wouldn’t sway her loyalty. “I am just hoping that we have enough people in the stadium saying ‘go birds’ that we will get my husband’s first win against the Kansas City Chiefs. … He’s 13 years in, he’s due I think,” she said.</p><p>Jason’s team eventually took home the win, and the brothers <a href=#>shared a heartfelt moment</a> on the field at the end of the game. “Late birthday present for you,” Travis told Jason in video footage shared via the NFL social media feeds. “Love you, big guy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku263xKWanmWapLimv4ywoJ%2BdXaDGrbXEZqKepJOaeqmt0maYpaqVlrG6edKenKdlmJq%2Fbq%2FHq6CsrJ2WwG6zyJ%2BraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-bahney.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Bahney | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jaime-feld-kevin-zegers-wife-and-net-worth-5-fast-facts-453433-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jaime Feld, Kevin Zegers Wife, And Net Worth 5 Fast Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
