He was the powerhouse behind the Chicago Bulls team. He became a pop culture phenomenon, starring in the movie Space Jam, having his own shoe (the “Air Jordan”), and excelling at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the sport of baseball</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Michael’s professional life is very well-known, his personal life has been somewhat shrouded. Yes, he’s been accused of having a gambling problem (which was later proved to be unfounded criticism), and the whole world knew when Michael’s father was brutally murdered. However, there’s not much more that fans know...especially regarding his love life.</p><p>Michael’s first wife, Juanita Vanoy, gave him three <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celeb offspring</a> - yes, we mean three beautiful children, but Michael and Juanita's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship ended</a> in 2006. After splitting from Juanita, Michael met Yvette Prieto, a former model living in Miami, Florida.</p><p>Michael and Yvette are now married but keep their relationship super-private. Here’s everything we could find on Michael’s latest lady!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cuban-born><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Cuban-Born</span></h2><p>Yvette Prieto was born in Cuba but grew up in Miami, Florida, which is the perfect place to celebrate her Cuban heritage! In Miami, she worked as a model for designers like Alexander Wang. Given Yvette’s shorter stature (she is 5’ 6”), she probably did a lot of print jobs, as opposed to runway work.</p><h2 id=famous-ex><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Famous Ex</span></h2><p>Apparently, Yvette is used to the spotlight! Before Michael, she dated Enrique Iglesias’s brother, Julio Iglesias, Jr. Julio certainly isn’t as famous as his brother, but he did find some success with music and television work that was geared toward the Latin community. Being a model at the time, Yvette was the perfect companion.</p><h2 id=love-in-the-club><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Love In The Club</span></h2><p>In 2007, just one year after divorcing Juanito Vanoy, Michael met Yvette while visiting a Miami nightclub. Given how they met, it’s obvious that Michael was initially attracted to Yvette’s outer beauty. However, considering how long they’ve lasted (13 years), he’s someone who appreciates her incredible character, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=took-things-slow><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Took Things Slow</span></h2><p>Having already divorced once, Michael was careful not to rush into another relationship. Therefore, Michael and Yvette started dating in 2007 but didn’t move in together until 2009. From there, they were engaged in 2011 and married in 2013. The two experienced six full years together before tying the knot!</p><h2 id=almost-royal-wedding><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Almost-Royal Wedding</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael and Yvette’s 2013 wedding</a> was super-lavish (of course - Michael is basketball royalty!) The Palm Beach wedding ceremony featured a beautifully decorated, 40,000 square-foot tent for dancing, food, and fun. Moreover, Robin Thicke and Usher were wedding singers!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Vs. Big Wedding: The Pros And Cons Of Each</a></span></p><h2 id=stepmom-and-mom><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Stepmom And Mom</span></h2><p>Being Michael Jordan’s wife means dealing with media attention and an ex-wife (who is shown here), but offers perks, such as wealth and high social status. Yvette now has three stepchildren from Michael’s previous marriage. In addition to these three adult stepkids, Yvette also has her own set of twins - Ysabel and Victoria -with the basketball star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Ana De Armas Ready To Be A Stepmom? Ben Affleck Just Stepped In That Direction</a></span></p><h2 id=super-private><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Super-Private</span></h2><p>There’s very little to know about Yvette and Michael’s relationship because the two keep their lives extremely private. Journalists have tried to find at least some dirt on Yvette but have come up with very little. Considering the amount of attention Michael used to have, privacy must be a relief.</p><h2 id=her-first-husband><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her First Husband</span></h2><p>When Michael and Yvette wed in 2013, Yvette was 34 years old and Michael was her first husband. So, Yvette was second-in-line to Juanita Vanoy - Michael’s first wife and the mother of three of his children. Luckily for Yvette, Michael and Juanita are pretty chill co-parents. They don’t have much drama.</p><h2 id=money-issues><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Money Issues</span></h2><p>Yvette Prieto filed for bankruptcy in 2002, when she was only 23 years old. Yvette’s past is pretty murky, so it’s hard to say exactly why she was in such a bind. One can only hope that her history of dating wealthy men isn’t based on some desperate money situation. One thing's for sure - she's not hurting for cash now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=great-reputation><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Great Reputation</span></h2><p>Perhaps Yvette isn’t a gold digger, after all! Yvette’s ex, Julio Iglesias Jr., has only great things to say&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about his former partner</a>. Apparently, she’s beautiful inside and out and has a great big heart. Michael is a lucky man! It’s rare for someone to speak kindly about his/her ex.</p><h2 id=lavish-lady><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lavish Lady</span></h2><p>For the wedding, Yvette wore a J’Aton designer wedding dress made of French silk and Swarovski crystals. She looked absolutely stunning! Yes, she was a somewhat older bride (being 34 years old), but the wait was worth it. J’Aton has dressed the likes of Beyoncé and Charlize Theron, so Yvette was in great company!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Best Celebrity Wedding Dresses Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=ballgirl><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ballgirl</span></h2><p>Michael Jordan is a basketball legend. It only makes sense that he can’t stay away from the game. Currently the owner of the Charlotte Hornets basketball team, Michael frequently watches basketball games - and Yvette tags along! These two actually enjoy watching the game. They aren’t just there for show!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=documentary-diva><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Documentary Diva</span></h2><p>Back in the days before Michael, Yvette was a force all by herself. She’s always been incredibly beautiful with a stunning personality. Therefore, it makes sense that she was featured in the documentary, Cuba: An Island Apart. Apparently, her role wasn’t that big, but she definitely represented the country well!</p><h2 id=no-last-dance-for-her><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>No Last Dance For Her</span></h2><p>Although she was featured in a documentary about Cuba, Yvette Prieto was nowhere to be seen in Michael Jordan’s ESPN documentary, The Last Dance. Considering the series focuses primarily on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls from the 1980s to 1990s, she wasn’t exactly necessary to the plot. Sorry, Yvette!</p><h2 id=happiness-abounds><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Happiness Abounds</span></h2><p>Little is known about Michael Jordan’s wife, but one thing is certain: she adores Michael and these two are having a great time. Everywhere they go, Yvette has the biggest smile on her face and Michael looks incredibly happy, as well. It’s nice to know that they’ve found true love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Kevin James' Wife?
