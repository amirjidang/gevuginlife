After watching&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show for the past 11 seasons, having a talk show seems like easy&nbsp;work. Invite some famous friends over, ask important questions, play fun music to get the audience involved...It sounds like a dream job compared to a 9-5 desk job. However,&nbsp;if these 10 former talk shows are anything to go by, daytime television and late-night TV is anything but easy work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest UK Talk Show Hosts</a></span></p><p>From low ratings to unoriginal ideas, these 10 celebrities may be popular in their own right but their talk shows didn't make the cut. While these shows might have initially seemed like good ideas, they ultimately flopped.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner>KRIS JENNER</h2><p>For a momager and owner of an empire, Kris Jenner works harder than both the president and the Devil combined. Up until her talk show, there seemed to be nothing this woman couldn't do. Just look at the unimaginable careers she created for all six of her kids (er, five...Sorry, Rob).</p><p>Sadly, unlike everything else Kris does, her talk show,&nbsp;Kris Jenner Show,&nbsp;was canceled after its trial run, failing to last&nbsp;even a whole season. Shown on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox network</a>, Fox execs claim Kris was "uninteresting" and looked like a "deer in headlights."</p><h2 id=wayne-brady>WAYNE BRADY</h2><p>Wayne Brady can do all things. He can sing, dance, act, do improv — he's a man that was meant to be in the spotlight. Handing him his own talk show seemed like an easy thing to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it didn't end up that way.</p><p>The Wayne Brady Show was his daytime talk show and lasted for two seasons. Surprisingly, his show won him five Daytime Emmy Awards (!!), but the ratings didn't show the same kind of love and the talk show was eventually canceled.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks>TYRA BANKS</h2><p>Tyra Banks will forever be known as one of the most prominent supermodels. She is stunning beyond measure. Once she got a little older, she decided to give back to the modeling world and created what we're all obsessed with today,&nbsp;America's Next Top Model.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest Late Night Talk Show Hosts, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>But if you can remember, that's not the only show Tyra hosted. She also had her own show,&nbsp;The Tyra Banks Show, where she interviewed guests — primarily focusing on women. The show was a success and lasted for five seasons and why it ended varies on who you talk to. There were rumors Tyra canceled it herself but it was also said that the show was just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"too expensive"</a> to keep going.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chevy-chase>CHEVY CHASE</h2><p>Chevy Chase is truly a Hollywood icon. The hilarious actor brought a sense of comedic timing that was practically unmatched by other comedians. Giving him a talk show seemed like it would be the golden ticket.</p><p>Why wouldn't it thrive? However,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chevy Chase Show</a> didn't perform well at all and was canceled only a month in by Fox.</p><h2 id=queen-latifah>QUEEN LATIFAH</h2><p>Most celebrities feel untouchable or unrelatable. Their life seems so above our means that it's hard to relate to anything they're doing. On the other hand, Queen Latifah comes across as so relaxed and approachable that a talk show&nbsp;seemed like an easy fit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Net Worth Of Your Favorite Day Time Talk Show Hosts</a></span></p><p>As great as a woman and host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Latifah</a> is, her talk show was canceled after the second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=russell-brand>RUSSELL BRAND</h2><p>Russell Brand is one of those celebrities you can't stop watching. He says the most unique things (in such a beautiful accent) with such flair that it's hard to look away. You would think a talk show with him as the face would make viewers do the same thing; sadly, it did the opposite.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand X With Russell Brand</a> appeared on late-night FX for two years before getting the snip. But Brand wasn't left in the streets. Instead of his late-night show, a pilot of his was picked up by the network instead.</p><h2 id=bethenny-frankel>BETHENNY FRANKEL</h2><p>Say what you want about&nbsp;the Real Housewives but if any of them have a chance as succeeding after their life on Bravo has come to an end, it's&nbsp;Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Daytime Talk Show Hosts Of 2019</a></span></p><p>She's already self-made due to her lucrative Skinny Girl brands, so a talk show seemed like a logical step in her career. Her show&nbsp;Bethenny launched in 2012 and unfortunately didn't make it past the first season. The famous face took the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancelation</a> in good spirits though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zach-galifianakis>ZACH GALIFIANAKIS</h2><p><a href=#>Zach Galifianakis</a>, in a word, is hilarious. There's nothing he can't make funny. But before he made it big in Hollywood movies, he had his own late-night show,&nbsp;Late World with Zach.</p><p>The show premiered in 2002 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VH1</a> and was a roundtable of sorts, where he talked with famous friends about Hollywood happenings. But after nine weeks, his chance as a talk show host ended. Thankfully, that wasn't the last we saw of him.</p><h2 id=megan-mullally>MEGAN MULLALLY</h2><p>Megan Mullally is such a unique figure in Hollywood. Everyone knows her for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will & Grace</a> and even as Tammy II on&nbsp;Parks and Recreation, but she also spent a short time in front of the camera as a host on&nbsp;The Megan Mullally Show.&nbsp;</p><p>The show launched on NBC back in 2006 but was surprisingly canceled in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">middle</a>&nbsp;of the first (and only) season.</p><h2 id=khlo-kardashian>KHLOÉ KARDASHIAN</h2><p>Just like her mama Kris, Khloé seemed to have a real knack for conversation and getting personal with just about anyone. Out of all the <a href=#>Kardashian-Jenners</a>, Khloé seemed like the best fit for a talk show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show released on FYI back in 2016 and shockingly lasted only a season. With cocktails in hand, Khloé invited her famous friends over where they'd all talk and ask each other questions. It was eye-opening and fun but ultimately didn't make the cut. According to multiple sites, it wasn't the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viewership</a> that was the problem, it was the drama behind the scenes that got the show canceled.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest Paid Talk Show Hosts In America</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nk5q5pq7RoquinaNivLi6jK2YpaNdqLWww4ycmKeblaGypXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-most-expensive-diet-food-delivery-services.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Most Expensive Diet Food Delivery Services</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-best-hip-hop-record-labels-of-all-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Best Hip-Hop Record Labels of all Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
