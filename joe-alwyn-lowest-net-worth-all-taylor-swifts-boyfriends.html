But perhaps one of the most striking things about her is just how much she's worth. <a href=#>Taylor built up her $400 million net worth</a> from practically nothing, and she's developed some business smarts over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that has concerned fans over the years, however, is that Taylor seems so in love with the idea of love (she's sung as much!). Her falling-fast habit had fans worried, especially as Swift's net worth continued to climb.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zendaya vs Taylor Swift: Whose Net Worth Is Higher?</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, it seems that most of Taylor's exes have been pretty well-heeled themselves, so there's little chance that any of them were simply using her for her cash. Although using her for her fame might've been on some of their radars.</p><p>Either way, Taylor's maintained her impressive net worth over the years, but fans wonder how her current beau stacks up. Does Joe Alwyn's net worth rival Taylor's, and can he compete with any of her exes?</p><h2 id=what-is-joe-alwyn-39-s-net-worth>What Is Joe Alwyn's Net Worth?</h2><p>Before Joe and Taylor began dating in 2016, Alwyn was already an actor on some fans' radars. Though it was surprising to find out that the two were dating, T Swift's dating history proves that it's a small, small world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But thanks to Joe's acting background, he's built up a $4M net worth over the years. No word on whether any of that cash comes from his contributions to Taylor's highly sought-after albums, but it could have.</p><p>In fact, some sources argue over whether Joe is worth $4M or $5M, and perhaps that boost is due to his earnings from 'Folklore' and other projects?</p><p>Anyway, how does Joe Alwyn's net worth stack up in terms of Taylor's previous boyfriends? To be honest, he's not worth nearly as much as some of her exes, though he does have a few beat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-isn-39-t-the-39-poorest-39-of-taylor-39-s-partners>Joe Alwyn Isn't The 'Poorest' Of Taylor's Partners</h2><p>Though Joe currently holds the most important ranking in Taylor's life -- he's still dating her, of course! -- he definitely isn't the richest guy she's been with. That award goes to Calvin Harris, who's worth a crazy $240 million and is clearly <a href=#>Taylor's richest ex</a> by far.</p><p>And although <a href=#>Joe's net worth can't compete with other celebrity exes of Taylor's</a>, like Harry Styles or Jake Gyllenhaal ($80 million each) or even John Mayer ($70M) or Joe Jonas or Taylor Lautner (both $40M), he's not on the bottom of the list.</p><h2 id=what-does-joe-alwyn-do-for-a-living>What Does Joe Alwyn Do For A Living?</h2><p>Joe Alwyn is an actor, of course, but is that where he makes his money? It would seem so. Unlike some of Taylor's other famous exes, like Connor Kennedy, Joe doesn't seem to have family money. Instead, he's worked hard for his earnings, nabbing acting roles after completing formal training in school.</p><p>But thanks to what is clearly a creative side, Joe was able to jump in and help Taylor write and produce some of her biggest tracks to date, which will clearly earn him royalties of some sort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>It's not like Joe needs Taylor's help with his career, though. His projects include work with big names like Rachel Weisz, Shailene Woodley, Emma Stone, and Lena Dunham.</p><p>Clearly, he's got no trouble landing roles, even if he doesn't have to take on paid acting gigs to get by. There's no doubt Taylor is willing to contribute more than her fair share to the couple's expenses, given that she's 100 times richer than him. But with $4M, there's plenty Alwyn can do on his own, too.</p><h2 id=who-was-taylor-swift-39-s-lowest-net-worth-ex>Who Was Taylor Swift's Lowest Net Worth Ex?</h2><p>The one confirmed ex of Taylor's with the lowest net worth was Lucas Till, who she reportedly dated for a matter of months back in 2009. Till, who Taylor met while guest-starring in the 'Hannah Montana' movie, later appeared in Swift's video for 'You Belong with Me.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their relationship was very shortlived, by all accounts, and apparently, Lucas also dated Miley around that same time. Sources suggest that Lucas and Miley dated briefly while filming the movie, which Taylor wrote two songs for and also appeared in.</p><p>It doesn't seem there's any bad blood there, though the jury is still out on whether Miley and Taylor are officially friends. The friendship, or lack thereof, likely doesn't have anything to do with a shared ex from a decade ago, though. At least, fans hope not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, Lucas didn't stick with either famous lady, and his net worth doesn't seem to have blossomed the way either of theirs has. Joe Alwyn on the other hand, is still working his way up in Hollywood (and the musical charts as William Bowery), so who knows where he'll rank a few years from now.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Details Behind Taylor Swift’s $80 Million Property Portfolio</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mo6ivlajBbrrErWSwp6KptW6ty6VkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2Bso2KvsMXFq6CeppSofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-fletcher-age-wikipedia-biography-height-husband-net-worth-family-bio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Fletcher Age, Wikipedia, Biography Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./courtney-love-talks-kicking-all-drug-addictions-dave-grohl-beef-2015112.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Courtney Love Talks Kicking &amp;quot;All&amp;quot; Drug Addictions, Dave Grohl Beef</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
