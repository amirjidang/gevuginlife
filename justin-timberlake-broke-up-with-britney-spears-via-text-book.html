Spears recalls feeling “clinically in shock” and “devastated” by how Timberlake pulled the plug on their relationship after three years together. Spears subsequently traveled back home to Louisiana, where Timberlake visited her with a handwritten letter that he framed.</p><p>“I was comatose in Louisiana, and he was happily running around Hollywood,” she added, according to an excerpt from <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>, which was posted on Thursday, October 19.</p><p>Spears’ book, which is set to be released on Tuesday, October 24, <a href=#>addresses the pop star’s ups and downs over the years</a>. In an excerpt from the memoir shared by People, Spears <a href=#>opened up about having an abortion</a> before her split from Timberlake.</p><p>“But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” she wrote. “I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby. I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p>The former couple <a href=#>dated from 1999 to 2002 after meeting on the set</a> of The Mickey Mouse Club. After their breakup, Timberlake raised eyebrows with the music video for his hit single “Cry Me a River,” which seemingly <a href=#>hinted that Spears was unfaithful.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Justin-Timberlake-Broke-Up-With-Britney-Spears-in-a-Text-Message-2.jpg><p>Before Spears revisited their past in her book, Timberlake issued a public apology to his ex for <a href=#>how he may have played a role in the negative attention</a> she received in the spotlight.</p><p>“I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right,” he wrote in a statement shared via Instagram in February 2021 following the release of the New York Times documentary Freeing Britney Spears. “The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success. It’s designed this way.”</p><p>Timberlake noted <a href=#>he still has “respect” for Spears</a> despite feeling like he “failed” her, adding, “As a man in a privileged position I have to be vocal about this. Because of my ignorance, I didn’t recognize it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life but I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again. I can do better and I will do better.”</p><p>Ahead of The Woman In Me’s debut, a source exclusively told Us that Timberlake <a href=#>was “not going to be happy” with the book</a> because Spears went “after him hard.” A second insider, meanwhile, clarified that Spears is simply sharing her truth.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s not Britney’s intention to skewer anyone. She’s just going to relay the facts from her perspective,” the second source continued.</p><p>The Woman in Me hits shelves on Tuesday, October 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq9506Kkm52ioa6ssYybqaijlWLCsXnWoquhZZKntrW6xLJkrKiVlr%2B0edWimGasla3Bbq7OqKJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashians-skims-nba-announce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian's SKIMS, NBA Announce Massive Multi-Year Partnership</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-ross-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Ross Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
