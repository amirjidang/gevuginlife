Before landing his own HGTV show, Holmes starred in Richard Rawling’s Garage Rehab, where he helped revive struggling mechanic shops around the country. The up-and-coming HGTV star also played the role of ‘fixer’ In Rawling’s Gas Monkey Garage empire. While Holmes might be living the dream at present, life has not always been easy for the New York native.</p><h2 id=russell-j-holmes-had-a-tough-childhood>Russell J. Holmes Had A Tough Childhood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After 20 years in the construction game, Russell J. Holmes has finally landed his own HGTV show. With some luck, Holmes could join the ranks of HGTV heavy hitters like Jonathan and Drew Scott 9 (Property Brothers), who have an <a href=#>estimated combined net worth of over $200 million</a>. Although the future shines bright for the father of two, his life has not always been a walk in the park.</p><p>“I didn’t have it easy early on,” <a href=#>Holmes disclosed to HGTV</a>. “My father died at 39 from alcoholism and my mother committed suicide after multiple attempts one year on Valentine’s Day.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How To Get On HGTV's My Lottery Dream Home And If The Show Is Actually Real?</a></span></p><p>Losing both his parents in such tragic ways inspired Holmes to become a first responder. “Witnessing many of those attempts propelled me to become an EMT and fueled my desire to help others,” he shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I never wanted to feel helpless again when it came to assisting someone in need and these days, I’m passionate about anything that deals with suicide prevention.”</p><h2 id=russell-j-holmes-rsquo-adult-life-has-not-been-an-easy-ride>Russell J. Holmes’ Adult Life Has Not Been An Easy Ride</h2><p>Holmes’ adult life also came with its own set of challenges. Presumably due to his problematic childhood, Holmes was unable to attain a high school diploma. However, after welcoming two sons with his ex-wife, Regina T. Holmes, the Garage Rehab alum thought it prudent to give his education another shot.</p><p>“I didn’t graduate from high school,” he admitted. “It was important to me to get that degree because how could I tell my kids they have to get an education when I didn’t finish mine?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is 'Moving For Love'? A Detailed Look At HGTV's New Reality Show</a></span></p><p>The 49-year-old also struggled with alcoholism for most of his adult life. Although Holmes is now eight years sober, attaining this goal mandated radical change and continuous self-reflection.</p><p>“During the process of becoming sober, I had to do the step work and acknowledge what was causing me to be that person,” he shared with HGTV.</p><p>“Sure, there are medical studies that show alcoholism is hereditary due to an addictive gene, but there’s the other part of it which deals with how you internalize things and the lifestyle you lead," he continued.</p><p>"Now, I go to bed every night and evaluate my day and figure out how I can do the right thing and be a better person the next day. Having that perspective in life is a great gift.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=russell-j-holmes-uses-his-experiences-to-inspire-his-clients>Russell J. Holmes Uses His Experiences To Inspire His Clients</h2><p>Holmes’ experiences have evolved into a source of inspiration for his clients. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 interview with MotorTrend</a>, the Garage Rehab star revealed that he shares both his mistakes and successes with his clients in a bid to help them transform their businesses.</p><p>"We give them stuff not only based on what we've done to succeed in life, but the mistakes we've made in life,” he said, “because to me, if somebody can learn from the mistakes I've made, why not make that something that helps them? So we go in, and we use all our stuff—the good stuff and the bad stuff that's happened to us in life—and made these garages more successful because of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holmes’s struggles have also nurtured his passion and dedication to helping others and solving problems. The father of four excels at problem-solving so much that, were he to choose a word that resonates with his personality, he would go with ‘fixer.’ “That word [fixer] encompasses it all,” he admitted. “A lot of that came from growing up poor and not being able to hire anyone to fix things. I love being able to problem-solve.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqujmrmteclmn6iknZrAbrvFZqmepp%2BrrrW1zqdkoqWgpMC0tcGlnGacmZl6r7vTZp%2BarpVirq95xJqqsmWlpa%2Bztc2goKefXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-page-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-238462-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Page Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rossana-delgado-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-96906-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rossana Delgado Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
