You can pay someone to clean your house, raise your child or even get you out of prison, but even if you are one of the richest people, there is one exception. You can't pay someone to lose weight for you. So what’s the next best thing? Having someone cook diet food and deliver it straight to your doorstep. All you have to do is pay for the food and eat that and nothing else. Food delivery services offer nutritionally complete, delicious and most importantly, portion controlled meals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meal delivery services have been around for years. We all know the lower end ones like Nutrisystem and Jenny Craig, but despite celebrity endorsements, they don't exactly cater to the rich and fit. In recent years, a surge of super healthy diet delivery services have garnered an incredible amount of praise and attention. They don't offer pseudo-healthy overly processed junk food. These companies deliver freshly made, chef prepared meals. No matter what your dietary requirements are, if you can pay for it, someone will make you a healthy meal, whether it is vegan, raw, gluten free, sugar free, Paleo or something else.</p><p>However, using these services, which are basically one step below having a private chef, doesn't come cheap. Please note the prices below are for seven days of meal delivery service, but other options and prices vary within each program. Another detail to keep in mind is that availability varies greatly between locations. Different plans may be offered for local and national markets even within one program.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-freshology-384-65><strong>10. Freshology: $384.65</strong></h2><p>If Freshology were a reality show, it would be called Dieting with the Stars because it is endorsed by so many celebrities.
