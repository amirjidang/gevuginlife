The girls often talk their famous dad into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doing TikTok dances</a> and funny skits with them.&nbsp;Strahan also has older children (daughter Tanita, 29, and son, Michael Jr.) whom he shares with ex, Wanda Hutchins.</p><p>The short clip that allows us to check out Strahan's decorating chops and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of style</a> has him chatting with fellow former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Giants player</a> Carl Banks. Strahan stops the interview by saying that he has a question.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">First Luxury New York City Condo Officially Launched</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well I have a question real quick," Strahan asks Banks. "Why are we basically wearing the same shirt?"</p><p>It's a great question because as Strahan says, both men seem to be wearing the exact same cobalt blue pullover with a silver zipper near the throat.</p><p>"Because I want to be like you," Banks replies without missing a beat.</p><p>Strahan bursts out laughing and says that he only wished that was true.</p><p>If you can get past the coincidence and the laughter, you'll noticed a gray-toned shelving unit in the backdrop with a few books stacked up in a tidy way. Other posts on the host's Instagram show Strahan's fifth "child", his dog, Enzo enjoying the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury New York City</a> property. One post depicts Enzo taking in a nap on a sage-colored sofa, his back tucked into a patterned pillow, and a tiled floor and what looks to be a marble breakfast bar in the near distance while another post shows Enzo on the floor underneath a white dining table with matching patterned chairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daughters Sophia and Isabella graced one post which the former football player captioned, "Date Nights... = the best night!#LoveMyKids." The post shows the pair of teen girls sitting at a breakfast bar with identical dinners in front of them and full glasses of water. Behind them is the same sofa that Enzo napped on as well as three full panels of windows with a set of French doors which we are assuming leads out to a balcony with what are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">probably incredible views</a>.</p><p>Strahan actually owns several properties but his favorite location is the Upper West Side and not just because it's close to his place of employment, the Good Morning America studio.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Strahan told the New York Times</a> that he likes the N.Y.C.'s Upper West Side because "being a father, I like the family feel to it. you see mothers with strollers, people walking their dogs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went onto say that he also has an affinity for the neighborhood because he's "just Michael" as opposed to being treated as Michael Strahan, the celebrity.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Jersey Penthouse Sets New Record For Highest Price On The Market</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0sLvDZqSoqp6eu6h5wKacq6GTlnqutcKhmJ6kXajBs63HmqVmpKWtwrPFjKGmpp1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-fakest-mtv-shows-10-that-are-actually-real.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Fakest MTV Shows (10 That Are Actually Real)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./822925-wrestlemania-33-results-john-cena-nikki-bella-vs-the-miz-maryse.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WrestleMania 33 Results: John Cena &amp;amp; Nikki Bella vs The Miz &amp;amp; Maryse</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
