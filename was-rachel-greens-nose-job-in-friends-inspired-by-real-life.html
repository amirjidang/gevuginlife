They all had something embarrassing about themselves in the hilarious flashback scenes. But could Rachel's nose job have been <a href=#>inspired by real life</a>?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel was always conscious of her big nose,&nbsp;but&nbsp;she claims she only got her nose done because of a "deviated septum," which is more likely a fabrication than an excuse. According to the show, Rachel got her nose done when she was a teenager, in 1988, as she mentions in the episode, "The One With the Prom Video." But everyone saw past her lie and knew she only had it done to look prettier. Her sister Amy later exposes her and says, "Do you ever worry that Emma's going to get your real nose?" Of course this was a legitimate concern of hers.</p><p>But was the decision to include Rachel's nose drama in the show a reflection of real life? Friends fans will know that Jennifer Aniston has had a nose job just like her character. She reportedly had a nose job to correct a deviated septum in her 20s before she debuted on Friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Courtney Cox: Facts About Their Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Jennifer has previously spoken openly about having a Rhinoplasty (often referred to as a nose job) to correct a deviated septum in her twenties," a spokesperson from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>MYA Cosmetic Surgery</a>&nbsp;told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>. "This surgery could explain the change in Jennifer’s nose but we believe she may have asked for a slender more natural bridge and tip, making it a cosmetic Rhinoplasty. The result of the procedure is very natural and still in keeping with the natural proportions of her face."</p><p>Aniston&nbsp;also is reported to having her nose done again after she broke up with ex-husband Brad Pitt,&nbsp;and&nbsp;she had it for the same reasons Rachel lied about having hers,&nbsp;a deviated septum. In 2007, Anniston had a Rhinoplasty to help correct her deviated septum again, probably because of breathing issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Due to breathing problems, individuals may suffer from sleeping problems," plastic surgeon Joseph Russo explained the breathing problems caused by a deviated spetum on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. "A common example is sleep apnea. A sleep condition can affect the patency of an individual’s airways. When left untreated, it could lead to the blocking or closing up of a person’s airflow. Various treatments can be done at home, yet a corrective or revision rhinoplasty can help treat much of the problem."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Jennifer Aniston Has Revealed About Her Relationship With Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p>"It’s funny. I had [a deviated septum] fixed – best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years," Aniston told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2007, after what seemed like her third nose surgery. "Short of letting everybody have a feel, I don't know what else to do. I really am pretty happy with what God gave me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether Aniston's nose job was inspired by Rachel Green's nose job or not, it is a strangely similar situation to her character's. It could be likely that Aniston's first nose job happened because, just like her character, she didn't like the look of her nose. It could be true, though, because there are other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in-side jokes</a> that the show has slid in concerning real-life things in Aniston's life.</p><p>Remember when Joey and Chandler rode into Monica and Rachel's apartment on that hideous white dog statue after they won the&nbsp;apartment in a bet? Aniston owned that statue in real life, she got it from a friend when she was cast on the hit show, and let the production company have it.</p><p>Then in the episode where Monica and Chandler are getting married, Rachel has to find someone to officiate the wedding, and happens upon a Greek wedding. Aniston is Greek in real life and her grandfather changed their family name from Anastasakis to Aniston. In the show, one of the names of the couple is Anastassakis, they added an 's' to Aniston's original surname.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with also including an episode featuring Aniston's real-life husband at the time, Brad Pitt, Rachel's contract with L’Oréal is mentioned in a slight conversation Joey has with the mother of an actress he fell in love with. He calls her asking for Jennifer&nbsp;but gets her mother and says, "Oh, well I kinda need to talk to you too, Mrs. L’Oréal."</p><p>So the references to Aniston's life have cropped up here and there in the show and only real Aniston fans would get them. So if Aniston's real-life nose job was referenced through the show, it wouldn't be hard to believe. They should have had a whole episode dedicated to it called, "The One With The Nose Job."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Nearly Missed Out On Being Rachel!&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumqtdp66ktMSlZKCqlZq7tHnNqKqeZZqkr261zWadq6GVo7G0ecinqqmhopqxbq7YZqmemZxiuaqyxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-the-cast-of-the-chronicles-of-narnia-looks-like-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What The Cast Of The Chronicles Of Narnia Looks Like Today!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./walter-scott-jr-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Walter Scott Jr Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
