This fashion house is known for its luxurious though understated style, the brand a long-lasting testament to the quality of the British apparel maker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The House of Burberry has certainly come a long way from its humble origins as a serviceable shop for common people, particularly fisher folk, in Britain. With innovation, constant emphasis on quality, and great marketing, Burberry rules the fashion world. It is now worn by elite people, from moneyed fashionistas, to successful businessmen, to aristocracy and royalty.</p><p>Its classic plaid beige fabric, now known as the Burberry check, is instantly recognizable and desirable, driving billions in sales. Here are the top five most sought after pieces.</p><p><b>Burberry Caps</b></p><p>Some say that the Burberry caps suffered a decline in the last decade after it became associated with hooligans and churlish sports fans. Before that, the distinctive newsboy cap made with the very distinctive Burberry check was all the rage and is one of the most sought after items from the fashion company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent years, however, the Burberry cap has found a renaissance of sorts, with more and more people buying the item. The craze around the design has also spread towards places outside of Britain, also increasing the popularity of the cap in territories where there are no traces of prior associations between the design and hooligans.</p><p>For the brand, the cap is a bit less expensive, only a few hundred bucks. However, it is still a highly luxurious item that offer the same quality, chicness, and luxury as other items from the brand.</p><p><b>Burberry's Wellington Boots</b></p><p>Practical but aesthetically pleasing, Burberry's Wellington boots are now one of the brands most popular items. Like other wellies, these are designed to withstand England's wet weather, but since this is a high-end fashion brand, it comes with the plushness and luxury of a real Burberry product.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have different designs that can cost about somewhere between $3,000 and $15,000. The wellies had become so popular since the brand presented a complete line during fashion week a few years back. The only reason why it does not rank higher in this list is because some countries do not have the climate to accommodate the use of boots. Even so, the sales for the Burberry wellies are estimated at almost a half billion dollars every year.</p><p><b>The Burberry Coat</b></p><p>It figures that one of the most memorable, most sought after items in Burberry’s considerable magic shop of high-end fashion is its line of coats—after all those are one of the first original products of the company and its rugged history as an outfit for British soldiers.</p><p>Burberry’s trench became a global icon when glamorous individuals started using them for public appearances. Audrey Hepburn wore a Burberry trench for a scene at “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” while Humphrey Bogart also sported one in “Casablanca”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, a Burberry coat worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, the former <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, was so sought after ladies were lining up outside of the brand’s outlets for hours. Actress and model <a href=#>Emma Watson</a>, modeling a trench coat, caused stocks to be sold out in some locations. Annually, its classic coats, which usually cost upwards of $1,000 each, rakes in multiple tens of millions on sales upon thousands of orders.</p><p>It is easy to understand the fascination with the Burberry coats—they’re streamlined designs are very flattering and can be fit to be worn for a polished but comfortable everyday look.</p><p><b>Burberry Women’s Bag</b></p><p>Just recently, reports cited Burberry bags as the best-selling brand of designer, luxury brand. And certainly, for many women with means, their closet is not complete without a Burberry brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Burberry bags are beautiful, fun, fashionable, and as in all of the brand’s products of the highest qualities. The materials range from sumptuous satin and silk, to leathers, to exotic fibers done up in the most exquisite styles of different shapes and sizes. These women's purses can be used either for daytime activities or for evening affairs.</p><p>One of these bags can go from $3,000 to $20,000 depending on the make and rarity, raking in millions every year for the British brand. Despite the somewhat steep price, or maybe because of it, women covet these bags, many longing and hunting for these bags in order to add them up to a collection, much like art connoisseurs do with paintings or sculptures.</p><p><b>The Burberry Childrenswear</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>The items for the Burberry Childrenswear are for the fashionable youngster. The newly-launched line of clothing for children has been so successful that it ran out of stocks on many products within a few months of its official launch. One online website described this line as “so successful, it was a nightmare” for the brand—specifically for its production and logistics units.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There really is no telling why the line has become so successful, but with celebrity models like Romeo Beckham, son of soccer royalty <a href=#>David Beckham</a> and chic fashion mogul <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a>—or periodic appearance of stylish little lady Suri Cruise—daughter of actors <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a>—in the brand, it is easy to see how the line could have been so successful.</p><p>Each item in the line is about $500 to $2,000. But what is that amount compared to the confidence and beauty that each piece offers. Like the line for men and for women, the Burberry children are sleek, stylish, and classic—and quite simple, it would be hard to put a price on that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmabraKXsrO%2B2KxkraegYoJuuc6sq2arn6q0qcCMmp2tnaJivaqxwp6qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caylee-anthony-autopsy-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caylee Anthony Autopsy Report: Shining Light On A Tragic Mystery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryce-vine-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-222518-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryce Vine Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
