If you don’t tell me who it is, I’m going to put you in contempt,” the judge told Steel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The judge then gave Thug’s attorney one more chance to answer where he heard about a supposed under-the-table conversation, to which Brian refused yet again. “Mr. Steel, I’m going to ask you again. I need you to tell me how you got this information. This is so sacrosanct, to have a conversation in my chambers parroted to you,” the judge insisted. During this exchange, Steel motioned for a mistrial, but his motion was quickly denied as he was taken into custody.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Law & Crime reporter Cathy Russon then reported that, after an hour break, Judge Glanville sentenced Brian Steel “to serve 20 days in the Fulton County Jail to serve every weekend for criminal contempt.” Instead of<a href=#> fighting the sentence</a>, Steel asked if he could spend his prison time with Thugger to continue preparing for his case, opting to share a cell with the Atlanta rapper.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Steel has been instructed to serve his 20 days across the next ten weekends. He will report to “901 Rice Street NW, Atlanta, Georgia, 30318 at 7 PM on Fridays” and then be released at 7 PM on Sundays. Steel’s jail sentence will begin Friday, June 14, and is set to end Sunday, Aug. 18.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Steel asked the judge to allow him to serve that time at the Cobb County Jail, where Young Thug is being held, and not at the Fulton County Jail, which Glanville said he would consider,” The Post added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Young Thug’s RICO troubles have been looming over the rapper for two years now.
