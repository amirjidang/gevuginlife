The video got over 1 million likes, and I couldn't believe it!"</p><p>Valerie adds that when she overheard people at her school talking about it, she knew she was on to something.</p><p><strong>"I was so excited,"</strong> she smiles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Brianna Arsement Recalls The Moment She First Went Viral</a></span></p><p>It was a dream come true for the then-high schooler - especially because she'd long told her siblings YouTube fame was her calling.</p><p><strong>"I was pretty confident," </strong>she laughs, thinking back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"YouTube was just always something that grasped my attention, and I wanted to do it so badly."</p><p>Mission accomplished!</p><p>Having said that, asked what she'd be doing if not for YouTube, Valerie's answer is certainly not the answer one would expect.</p><p><strong>"I'd love to work at the airport, maybe as a flight attendant or customer service representative,"</strong> she chuckles, decisively.</p><p>"I definitely feel like it's not the typical answer, but I think the flight benefits would be the greatest thing - I love traveling so much."</p><h2 id=valerie-shares-the-biggest-lesson-she-39-s-learned-as-a-youtuber>Valerie Shares The Biggest Lesson She's Learned, As A YouTuber</h2><p>Unfortunately for travelers far and wide who'd no doubt love bumping into her on their commute, Valerie did discover YouTube - and she's learned a ton of important lessons through the experience.</p><p>Lesson number one? Ignore the haters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Hateful comments discouraged me for a while, and even made me delete videos I really loved when I was younger, so if I could go back and tell my younger self anything, it would be to ignore the haters and not care what people think."</p><p><strong>"I used to let that get to me as a kid, but in reality, those comments meant nothing,"</strong> she adds.</p><p>It's for precisely that reason that she'd encourage anyone else hoping to follow in her path to do the same.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Pressley Hosbach Shares Her Top Social Media Tips For Aspiring Content Creators</a></span></p><p><strong>"Let them motivate you instead of discourage you," </strong>she urges.</p><p>"There will <strong>always</strong> be people who want to put you down, but the best thing you can do is smile, and keep pushing."</p><h2 id=what-to-expect-from-valerie-in-2023-and-beyond>What To Expect From Valerie, In 2023 And Beyond</h2><p>One of the major perks of not letting hate get to her has been Valerie's astronomical growth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's even branched out into new ventures, like singing - and though she doesn't plan on becoming a full-time performer, she's loved the challenge.</p><p>"I have two songs out right now. I just love making music and music videos, so you can expect to see some new tracks, hopefully soon!"</p><p>As for what else she's hoping to work towards this year, she smiles that she'd love to grow her platform to even bigger heights.</p><p>"I would really love to hit 10 million on TikTok and get verified on Instagram. That's what I've wanted, ever since I started."</p><p>Her biggest goal by far, however, is decidedly humble - and it certainly reveals a thing or two as to why her fanbase is so loyal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I really want to get out there and meet more of my supporters,"</strong> she explains.</p><p>"I wouldn't be anywhere without them, so I'd love to do some type of tour with my other content creator friends. Just go across the country, meet everyone who follows us, and give them a big hug!"</p><p>We're holding thumbs for a tour sometime in the near future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmrZqklae2pnnLnqeepJOderC6jKCmoqaXYsOqvsClZJqmlGLEqa3TZqqhnZRisbB5yJ9krKCVYsSiv82tZJplk6S7tbHNrWScqpWWwbC%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-omarions-ex-girlfriend-left-him-for-his-best-friend-lil-fizz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heres Why Omarions Ex-Girlfriend Left Him For His Best Friend, Lil Fizz</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ed-ames-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-612478-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ed Ames Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
