It’s uninspired,’” host <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> said, while Lipa joked that many social media users said that she looked “like she’s trying to put her shoe on in a rush.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The singer continued, “There was a moment where it actually caused me a lot of grief, like, I was being bullied online. It wasn’t very nice.”</p><p>During the 2022 tour for her Grammy-winning sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, Lipa reclaimed the dance moves she had once been made fun of for by incorporating them into her performance — and making them better than ever.</p><p>“I can look at it from a different perspective,” the singer told Fallon, 49. “I look back at it with such fondness because it helped me grow into the artist that I wanted to become, it made me work harder.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuumV2htrGtjKucrKifo7G0edOoZK%2Bhopa5brDAp5qippdiuqa5xKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dylan-nalbandian-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-135130-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dylan Nalbandian Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drew-carey-net-worth-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Drew Carey Lives An Outrageous Lifestyle Thanks To His Yearly Salary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
