What is the first purchase that comes to mind? Would you continue to work? If you really think about it, having that much money could last you a lifetime if spent wisely. Maybe you would rather spend the money all at once. The options seem endless.</p><p>You could do the rounds at all of the Michelin-star restaurants, and try food that has been prepared by some of the worlds most renowned chefs. You could buy over 1.3 million gold flake cupcakes. You could buy 250&nbsp;Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sports!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are more into sight seeing, you could bring your family and all of your friends along with you to spend a year traveling the world.&nbsp;You could each stay in the most expensive hotel suites, travel to the most luxurious destinations, and cruise around in the most expensive cars, and still be left with tons of money!</p><p>This list simply provides you with various items you could purchase for a grand total of $1 billion. Go ahead and now allow yourself to dream of spending such an immense amount of money.</p><h2 id=10-round-trip-to-the-moon-750-million><b>10. Round Trip to the Moon – $750 Million</b></h2><p>Just because you aren't an astronaut that doesn't mean you can't ever visit the moon. Although even if you were an astronaut, there's a very small chance that NASA would send you to the moon, considering the last visit was in 1972. But don't worry, thanks to a company called Golden Spike, you and another lucky person has the ability to visit the moon. This trip is not fully funded, although once all money is in the right place, two people will have the ability to visit the moon as long as they have the $750 million for the trip! For $1.5 billion you can also walk on the moon, unfortunately this is above your $1 billion budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-2-airbus-a380-810-million><b>9. 2 Airbus A380 – $810 Million</b></h2><p>The Airbus A380 is considered to be the largest passenger airplane in the world. Built by the Airbus company, it is primarily used by major airlines, such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Lufthansa and Qantas. It uses an advanced architecture design called the Integrated Modular Avionics, or IMA, that was originally used in advanced military planes. The plane is so spacious that you can actually accommodate up to 853 people into it. One unit of this aircraft cost approximately $404 million. Buy two of them so that you will have a spare plane to serve as backup in case the first one is undergoing maintenance checkup. That will still leave you plenty of change at nearly $200 million, which you can use for fuel, runway and hangar fees.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-a-c-milan-945-million><b>8. A.C. Milan – $945 Million</b></h2><p>If you have a billion dollars, you can rival Russian tycoon&nbsp;<a title="Roman Abramovich Net Worth" href=#>Roman Abramovich</a>, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, by buying Associazione Calcio Milan, or A.C. Milan. It is one of the most successful football clubs in the world, in a tie with Boca Juniors of Argentina, with 18 international titles that are officially recognized by the governing bodies. It is probably the most popular team in Europe and it boasts of superstars like Stephan El Shaarawy,&nbsp;<a title="Kaka Net Worth" href=#>Kaka</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Robinho Net Worth" href=#>Robinho</a>&nbsp;and Sulley Muntari.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-19-1963-ferrari-gto-988-million><b>7. 19 1963 Ferrari GTO – $988 Million</b></h2><p>The 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO is considered as one of the top sports car of all time, and is probably the greatest Ferrari ever made. The GTO was in production from 1962 to 1964, and only 39 units were ever made. While a brand new Lamborghini Veneno Roadster goes for $5.3 million and lays claim as the most expensive brand new car, a 50-year old Ferrari GTO was recently sold for $52 million by Paul Pappalardo to an unknown buyer. At that price, you can buy almost half the entire production output of the vehicle with still a few million to spare.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-antilia-mumbai-1-billion><b>6. Antilia Mumbai – $1 Billion</b></h2><p>The&nbsp;<a title="The Billion Dollar Home of Mukesh Ambani" href=#>Antilia Mumbai</a>&nbsp;in India is probably the most expensive house in the world. It has 27 floors and has a full-time household staff of 600 personnel.&nbsp;<a title="Mukesh Ambani Net Worth" href=#>Mukesh Ambani</a>, the chairman of Reliance Industries, owns the place. It lies on an oceanfront property measuring 4,532 square meters in the city. All the floors feature high ceilings, with engineers estimating that if they were of normal height only, the house could have had up to 60 floors. At 400,000 square feet of living space, the house originally cost $70 million, but is now estimated to be worth a billion dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-chicago-cubs-1-billion><strong>&nbsp;5. Chicago Cubs – $1 Billion</strong></h2><p>The Chicago Cubs is the oldest existing professional sports franchise in North America. It was established in 1870 and has stayed in the city of Chicago the entire time, though it did miss a couple of seasons after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It is one of the two remaining charter members of the National League. it has won two World Series titles, though these were achieved in 1907 and 1908. The team is known as the Lovable Losers, but if you have the money, maybe you have what it takes to turn this billion-dollar franchise around.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-5-f-35c-lightning-ii-fighter-jets-1-billion><b>4. 5 F-35C Lightning II Fighter Jets – $1 Billion</b></h2><p>The F-35C Lightning II fighter jet is actually still under development. This jet fighter has been designed for a variety of purposes, including performing ground attacks, reconnaissance, and air defense with the capability to operate without radars detecting its presence. It is estimated to cost nearly $200 million each, so you can purchase up to five units of these aircraft.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-toronto-maple-leafs-1-billion>&nbsp;<b>3. Toronto Maple Leafs – $1 Billion</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Toronto Maple Leafs is the most valuable franchise in the National Hockey League, ahead of the New York Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens. The club was established in 1917 as the Toronto Arenas. It was renamed the St. Patricks in 1919, before it finally got the name of Maple Leafs in 1927. It is considered as one of the Original Six members of the league. But just like the two other North American sports franchises mentioned above, namely the Cubs and the Browns, the Maple Leafs are a hard luck squad whose last title came in 1967, the longest title drought for any NHL team.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-solomon-islands-1-billion>&nbsp;<b>2. Solomon Islands – $1 Billion</b></h2><p>The Solomon Islands is a country made up of several large islands to the east of Papua New Guinea. It is probably best known for Guadalcanal, which was the scene of some fierce fighting between the Americans and the Japanese in World War II. The country used to be a British colony, but it achieved independence in 1978. The country’s gross domestic product hovers around the billion-dollar mark.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-los-angeles-lakers-1-billion>&nbsp;<b>1. Los Angeles Lakers – $1 Billion</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, a North American sports franchise that won’t give you any heartache, though it did have a share of it in the past. The team was established in Minneapolis in 1947 where it won five titles, before moving to Los Angeles in 1960. This was when Lakers fans suffered annual heartbreaks, losing six times to the Boston Celtics in the Finals. It finally broke through in 1972, and has since won 10 more rings, including five in the 80s and another five in the 2000s. By buying this franchise, you get to inherit the history, tradition, the great players, and the celebrity fans that regularly watch its games. Think about owning a team that includes world renowned players such as&nbsp;<a title="Kobe Bryant Net Worth" href=#>Kobe Bryant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Steve Nash Net Worth" href=#>Steve Nash</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatoJViwbC8jGpnZqyYnruov4yypq5lk5a7bq7UsmSinl2uvLZ5x5qbZpldl7atuMiopWacn6G5or7SZmlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-celeb-couples-with-the-biggest-age-gap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Celeb Couples With The Biggest Age Gap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-people-who-survived-horrible-incidents-against-all-odds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 People Who Survived Horrible Incidents Against All Odds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
