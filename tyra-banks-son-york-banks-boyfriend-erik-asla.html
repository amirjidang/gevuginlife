In the early days, it appeared that the little one was spending time between both Banks' and Asla's residences, via pictures on social media.</p><p>More recently, however, it appears that York is spending more time <a href=#>being raised by his mother</a> than his father.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tyra Banks Trends On Twitter For Abusive Behavior In Resurfaced ANTM Clip</a></span></p><p>Some of this speculation could have to do with the Dancing With the Stars host being a higher profile name than the professional photographer and more news outlets publishing pictures, stories, and interviews with Banks than Asla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It could also have to do with the fact that the two try to keep York off social media as much as possible so when he does spend time with his father, the public is unaware.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, it does appear that Banks may be the main caretaker for York.</p><p>Here is why people question whether Tyra Banks is raising her son with his father, Erik Asla.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks-visibly-parents-york-more-than-erik-asla>Tyra Banks Visibly Parents York More Than Erik Asla</h2><p>There is no question that Banks is a high-profile commodity when she is out in public. She steps out and the paparazzi follow.</p><p>As such, it is not surprising that several photos as of late have been of Banks accompanying her son, York. What is not seen, however, are photos of Asla out with the little one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Asla is well known in the photography and modeling world, he is not a public figure that garners the attention that the America's Got Talent alum does.</p><p>Asla may be able to more easily move around in public than Banks can, making him less of a target for the paparazzi.</p><p>As a result, it means fewer photos of him together with York. However, fewer pictures are not concrete evidence that Banks is raising her son without Asla.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks-39-mom-moved-in-to-help-during-the-pandemic>Tyra Banks' Mom Moved In To Help During The Pandemic</h2><p>While Banks worked on the set of Dancing With the Stars in 2020, she did not want to bring her son to the set where he could be potentially exposed to COVID.</p><p>Instead, Banks had her mother, Carolyn London, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">move in to watch the youngster</a> while she was away at work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tyra Banks Posts A Photo Of Her Mom And Fans Are Obsessed With The Resemblance Between The Two</a></span></p><p>There is no information about why York did not go to be with his dad during this time. It could have to do with Asla living with his three daughters, Tatjana, Taylor, and Tatum, and having his hands full with homeschooling two of them during that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Or perhaps Banks and Asla wanted to keep exposure levels to COVID as low as possible for York and keeping him to one household was the best way to do that.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, between London moving in and Banks being the one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible for homeschooling York,</a> the pandemic had York spending more time with the former model and not his father.</p><h2 id=no-recent-pictures-of-york-have-been-posted-on-erik-asla-39-s-instagram>No Recent Pictures Of York Have Been Posted On Erik Asla's Instagram</h2><p>Up until a few years ago, pictures of York were a constant on Asla's Instagram. These days, the pictures are non-existent.</p><p>The last pictures of York on Asla's account were from March 2021. This particular picture does not name which of his children it is, it just shows little feet on an ottoman. But because the fashion photographer's girls are much older than York, it can only be assumed to be the little one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Pics Show Just How Much Tyra Banks Has Changed Since The Early '90s</a></span></p><p>However, there are no pictures of York on his dad's social media since that time.</p><p>This could very well have to do with both Asla and Banks making a conscious decision to keep their son out of the media as much as possible. It could again also have to do with York spending more time with Banks as a result of COVID.</p><p>But whatever the reason, York does not nearly have the presence on Asla's Instagram feed that he used to, which only adds fuel to the fire that Banks may have a larger presence in her son's life than his father does.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks-and-erik-asla-both-live-in-the-same-area>Tyra Banks And Erik Asla Both Live In The Same Area</h2><p>After Banks and Asla amicably broke up in 2017, the two parents made the decision to do what was best for their son. And part of that appears to be living in the same area in Southern California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the duo decided that they were better off as co-parents than as a couple, Asla moved out of the home that he and Banks shared. Instead of moving back to Europe or New York, Asla made the decision to stay in Southern California where he currently lives with his three daughters.</p><p>There have been rumors that Banks moved in with her beau, Louis Bélanger-Martin in a massive mansion in Canada. However, given that Banks recently opened a new ice cream business in Southern California and has a panache for flipping houses in the area, it seems unlikely this is the case.</p><p>What seems more likely is that Banks continues to live in Southern California, not only because it is where she is from, but because it gives York an opportunity to split time between her and Asla's homes.</p><p>While people want to read into why York is seen more often with Banks than with Asla, it is only because the two parents want to keep their family lives private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result, rumors will continue to swirl. But unless there is something concrete that shows Asla has stepped away from his role as York's father, all signs point to him and Banks continuing to raise York together but separately.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Tyra Banks Is Really Like Behind The Scenes On 'Dancing With The Stars'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirsqqRYq%2BiusqsZKynnmLGsL7KZpmappuoeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqmvsikZJqrnJZ8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jane-fonda-net-worth-bio-age-ethnicity-husband-height-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jane Fonda- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Husband, Height, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-42-dugg-hair-real-long-hairstyle-how-did-he-grow-his-hair-635039-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is 42 Dugg Hair Real?
