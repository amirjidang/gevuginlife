It was a disaster. By 2016, they were divorcing and Amber was claiming that Johnny had been physically abusive towards her during their marriage. She even showed up to court one day sporting bruises she claimed had been inflicted by Depp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world and his dog rounded on Depp. He went from Hollywood's A-list to Tinseltown's black-list. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">J.K. Rowling</a>&nbsp;got no end of grief when she cast him as Grindelwald in&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.&nbsp;And Disney has apparently decided to drop him from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>&nbsp;franchise.</p><p>It didn't help that in December of 2018, Heard penned an op-ed for&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;which didn't mention Depp's name but discussed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"her experience with abuse"</a>. A few months later Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard over the op-ed.</p><p>And it drags on and on and on. To complicate matters, Depp is also suing the UK tabloid newspaper&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;for libel. Seems they called him a "wife-beater". Not surprisingly, he took objection to that.</p><p>Why might the suits be a big mistake? Let's take a look and see. In part, it comes down to this: Once you start slinging mud around, some of it invariably sticks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=even-if-he-wins-a-lot-of-bad-stuff-about-him-is-out-there>Even If He Wins, A Lot Of Bad Stuff About Him Is Out There</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Heard</a>'s lawyers have reportedly lined up a stable of witnesses that are willing to say Heard was abused by Depp. If the case does not settle out of court, these witnesses will be put on the stand to tell their version of events. A lot of detail may come out. And it won't be flattering to Depp.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About Amber Heard Since The Johnny Depp Scandal</a></span></p><p>In addition to that,&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;newspaper claims that it has copies of texts from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp to his assistant asking for drugs</a> just days before Amber Heard claims she was assaulted. They say the drug was probably ecstasy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What It's Like To Work For Johnny Depp</a></span></p><p>And, no doubt there will be more to come. Sure, some of it may be damaging to Amber Heard and her career. But Depp's career, currently on the brink, might be pushed into oblivion by the leaks and revelations. It's harder to stage a comeback if you are a 50-something (Depp), as opposed to a 30-something (Heard). The clock is ticking loudly for Johnny Depp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some say Depp should have learned his lesson on the hazards of filing lawsuits when he sued his managers for incompetence and mishandling his money. Sure, he settled it out of court in 2018, but not before details&nbsp;of what his managers termed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his over-the-top spending were leaked</a>. The $30,000 a month he supposedly spent on alcohol was bad enough. But he reportedly paid $200,000 a month for the use of a private jet, $1.2 million a year to keep a private doctor on call, and $75 million on 14 residences.</p><p>And let's don't forget the private island and what seemed like compulsive overspending on art. He came out of the suit looking like a man out of control, a man who was his own worst enemy, and a guy that had single-handedly blown $100 million of his $450 million net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Expensive Things Johnny Depp Has Purchased</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's what happens when your dirty laundry gets washed very publicly. But he obviously didn't learn a thing from the experience.</p><h2 id=was-the-heard-op-ed-a-bad-move-or-a-deadly-trap>Was The Heard Op-Ed A Bad Move Or A Deadly Trap?</h2><p>Some say that Amber Heard's op-ed detailing her experience with abuse was a real cock-up on her part. Until then, Depp really had no grounds on which to sue her. Sure, she had said a lot of bad stuff about him in court during the divorce, but you can't really sue somebody for claims they made in court.</p><p>But others say that the op-ed was a trap intended to push Johnny Depp into taking action, knowing full well that if he did her accusations against him would once again go viral, further damaging his career.</p><p>Sure, she might be seen as a cheater and a liar, but that's not as bad as being suspected of being a drunken, drug-addicted wife-beater, is it?</p><h2 id=if-he-loses-it-s-all-over-for-him>If He Loses, It's All Over For Him</h2><p>So, there's a lot of dirt flying around. That's bad enough. But if he loses to Amber Heard? It's going to be a complete melt-down of a disaster because, albeit indirectly, it reinforces Heard's version of events. Career over. Finished. Dead. He will become Johnny Depp the wife-beater forevermore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Sun&nbsp;libel case will be heard on July 7th, 2020. If his lawyers manage to talk the newspaper into settling out of court, it may be a kind of mini-victory for Depp. A win for Depp in court would bolster his chances of prevailing over Heard. But (and it's a <strong>big</strong> but) if Depp loses that one, it will be the first nail hammered into his professional coffin. A loss to Heard would finish off the job. That's why the lawsuit could be Depp's biggest mistake ever.</p><p>Win, lose or draw, it won't be the end of the lawsuit trail for Depp. According to his now-former managers, he has spent millions and millions on lawyers "to bail him out of numerous legal crises" and to pay "hush money".</p><p>He's just that kind of guy. If he loses, he may just be forced to retire to his 5-house compound in Los Angeles to contemplate his next lawsuit. Our money is on him suing the lawyers that lost him the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pirates of the Caribbean 6 Is Off To A Bumpy Start: Disney Doesn't Want Johnny Depp</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7ypus2yZJ2doKXAbrjAsKquoaRirqityKeqrWWRoq%2BmvoyhnJqqlGK6osWMm5xmrJiaeqO1xqCcrKxdora0wMCknGanlmK1qr%2BMpaCfnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./witney-carsons-family-album-with-husband-carson-mcallister-son-leo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Witney Carson's Family Album With Husband Carson McAllister, Son Leo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stine-schyberg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Alex Van Halen's Wife Stine Schyberg?
