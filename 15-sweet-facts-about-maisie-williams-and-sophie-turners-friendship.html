When you're working with someone every day for eight years, it's probably a good idea to share a good relationship with them. The show concluded its last episode almost a year ago - while many of the cast members have gone their separate ways and moved on with their lives, some have stayed close, like Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their relationship on-screen was never really close. Sophie played Sansa Stark, who was the older sister of the wild child, Arya Stark, who was played by Maisie. There were many ups and downs between the two characters, but off-screen, Sophie and Maisie were slowly becoming major BFF goals. Want to know how close they really are? Keep on reading!</p><h2 id=they-basically-grew-up-together><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They Basically Grew Up Together</span></h2><p>When Game of Thrones first started filming, Sophie and Maisie were barely even teenagers! They met when they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 and 13</a>, meaning they pretty much grew up together during their time on GoT. Since they were so similar in age, it didn’t take long for them to form a pretty serious bond.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Maisie Williams' Evolution Since Season 1 Of Game Of Thrones</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-chemistry-is-amazing><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Their Chemistry Is Amazing</span></h2><p>Sophie and Maisie’s characters never seemed to get along that well until the last season of the show, but their chemistry off-screen has remained unmatched throughout the years. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Maisie Williams described her instant chemistry with Sophie as “real magic”. These two were certainly meant to find each other!</p><h2 id=so-much-so-that-they-even-sparked-dating-rumors><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>So Much So That They Even Sparked Dating Rumors!</span></h2><p>It’s obvious that Maisie and Sophie aren’t afraid to physically express their friendship. This has caused many people to believe their relationship might be a little more than platonic. We can't blame them, since apparently the two used to "prank" the GoT cast and crew by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">locking lips</a> during random takes!</p><p>Obviously, they’re just really good friends who aren’t afraid to get a little touchy-feely. After all, Sophie is married to Joe Jonas and Maisie is dating Reuben Selby.</p><h2 id=their-closeness-and-antics-made-them-a-nightmare-to-work-with><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Closeness And Antics Made Them A Nightmare To Work With</span></h2><p>Best friends don’t always make the best co-workers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with pranking their fellow cast and crew, Sophie and Maisie were reportedly nothing but trouble together on the set. Sophie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> that they would never get anything done on set since they were always goofing around, and that directors probably regretted writing scenes where she and Maisie would be together. At least they kept things interesting?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Maisie Williams And Sophie Turner That Make Us Miss Game Of Thrones</a></span></p><h2 id=they-ve-always-been-there-for-each-other><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They've Always Been There For Each Other</span></h2><p>Going through puberty is hard enough - we can’t imagine having those years documented so closely for the whole world to see. Since Sophie and Maisie were both growing up at the same time, it caused them to become even closer.</p><p>What’s even worse is that Maisie’s character had to have a shaved head around that time - that can certainly mess with a person’s psyche when it comes to body image, especially in the teenage years. Good thing she had Sophie helping her through it the whole time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-their-relationship-once-had-a-destructive-side><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>But Their Relationship Once Had A Destructive Side</span></h2><p>Sophie Turner once described her relationship with Maisie Williams as “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite destructive</a>”, and it wasn’t because of their on-set antics. The two were so close while filming that they wouldn’t even socialize with anyone but each other. She went on to admit that this isolation lasted for years. I guess we should all get BFFs that we can shut out the world with?</p><h2 id=they-have-their-own-nickname><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Have Their Own Nickname</span></h2><p>Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner’s relationship has become so popular, they even have their own nickname. But it wasn’t fans that pinned it on them - it was actually the girls themselves. It all started after Maisie saw a phone case called “Mophie”, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> it was a terrible name for a phone case, but an amazing one for her and Sophie. And thus, “Mophie” was born.</p><h2 id=they-used-to-have-sleepovers-constantly><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Used To Have Sleepovers Constantly</span></h2><p>Throughout their years of growing up and filming together, Sophie and Maisie would do what BFF’s do best and have sleepovers. These weren’t just occasional, though - apparently, the girls would spend almost every night together. Maisie even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that she thinks she’s spent more time in Sophie’s bed than her own!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-celebrate-a-special-day-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Celebrate A Special Day Together</span></h2><p>Both Maisie and Sophie found out on the same day that they had landed their roles on Game of Thrones. They got the good news on August 7th, 2009, and since it’s also the day that brought them together, it holds a very special place in their hearts. Sophie once posted a photo of her and Maisie to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, captioning it “Happy 7th August soulm8”.</p><h2 id=and-turned-it-into-matching-tattoos><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And Turned It Into Matching Tattoos</span></h2><p>What’s the best way to ensure that your bond with someone really lasts a lifetime? Get matching tattoos!</p><p>Maisie and Sophie decided to commemorate their friendship by spontaneously getting some matching ink. They did this one day while they were in Belfast. They got “07.08.09” tattooed on their upper forearms to represent their start on GoT, as referred to previously.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner Were #SquadGoals</a></span></p><h2 id=maisie-was-sophie-s-maid-of-honor><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Maisie Was Sophie's Maid Of Honor</span></h2><p>If you still aren’t convinced of their BFF status, this might help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s no surprise that the two shared some of their greatest life events, and that includes weddings. Maisie is so close to Sophie that she even served as one of Sophie’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">maids of honor</a> during her wedding to Joe Jonas last year!</p><h2 id=they-like-to-coordinate-their-red-carpet-outfits><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Like To Coordinate Their Red Carpet Outfits</span></h2><p>Are you even BFF’s if you don’t have matching outfits?</p><p>As super-cute and super-trendy as they are, obviously Sophie and Maisie are going to coordinate their outfits sometimes. The two friends have gone so far as to match their red carpet ensembles. They are seen here wearing matching sparkly black dresses at a Game of Thrones premiere.</p><h2 id=their-relationship-may-inspire-a-movie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Relationship May Inspire A Movie</span></h2><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue Paris</a>, Sophie Turner talked about wanting to get into producing and directing with Maisie. When asked what her first project would be, Sophie described it as a movie “"about a friendship where it's kind of like you're soulmates, but you're friends and it's like this beautiful connection but it can also be quite destructive." So, basically their relationship! We’d definitely go and see it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-done-pretty-much-everything-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They've Done Pretty Much Everything Together</span></h2><p>We’ve already established that Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner are extremely close and have even blurred the lines a time or two. But how far do they take it? The two&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that they’ve gone so far as to take showers and baths together in the past. I guess they really are THAT close…</p><h2 id=they-ve-gone-through-some-dark-times-but-they-ve-always-supported-each-other><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They've Gone Through Some Dark Times, But They've Always Supported Each Other</span></h2><p>When your life is made so public as a celebrity, it opens it up to other people’s opinions. Sophie and Maisie experienced that firsthand, through social media, and shared a really rough patch together. This happened once their careers started to pick up.</p><p>The impact of that caused both of them to experience intense depression and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suicidal thoughts</a>. They both played a major role in helping each other through that time, especially since Sophie convinced Maisie to start <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attending therapy</a>. They sure do have each other’s backs.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things About Sophie Turner And Maisie Williams People Always Forget</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWjrLKmwIyfmJyso2Kuo7vUrWSmmZmotqZ51qKjpaGRosBurc2dZKynoJ22pnnTrqmnnaKoeqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-surprising-facts-about-katie-holmes-and-suri-cruises-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Surprising Facts About Katie Holmes And Suri Cruise's Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./12-gorgeous-women-whove-dated-the-most-athletes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>12 Gorgeous Women Who've Dated The Most Athletes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
