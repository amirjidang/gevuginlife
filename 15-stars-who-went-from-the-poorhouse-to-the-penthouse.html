But not all stars started out with a silver spoon in their mouth. Sure, these 15 celebs below are rolling in dough now, but before they made it big in their careers, they could barely make ends meet. Down in the dumps is an understatement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether they were from humble beginnings, down on their luck, bankrupt, or out of work, these 15 stars were once far from the millionaires they are today. They worked hard and used their talents and drive to go from the “poorhouse” to the “penthouse,” so to speak.</p><p>From scraping coins together to pay the rent and buy food to owning designer clothing, mansions, and luxury cars, these 15 stars are living proof that people do have the chance to turn their life around with the right mix of luck, timing, motivation, and a never-give-up attitude.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is cut out to be a celeb, but these 15 men and women saw their dreams come true by becoming famous entertainers. Who knows how their lives would have turned out if they had not made it in the biz. All we know is that we are glad they dug themselves out of the darkness and were able to live out their goals and aspirations of becoming more successful than they could have ever imagined.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Check out these 15 inspiring and amazing stories of rags to riches from some of your favorite celebrities.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-is-a-self-made-queen><strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> Is A Self-Made Queen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The 35-year-old Nicki Minaj is one of the hottest stars these days, but there was a time when the singer/rapper was living the hard life. She moved to the United States from Trinidad with her family when she was just 5 years old, and they settled in Queens, NY.</p><p><strong>The family was quite poor and struggled throughout Minaj’s childhood.</strong></p><p>Once Minaj made her way in the music biz, things took a great change for the better. With major hits like "Bang Bang," "Anaconda," "Super Bass," "Starships," "Feeling Myself," and "Truffle Butter," the star has made millions and is still going strong. She is now able to support her family and do things she only dreamed of as a kid in a poverty-stricken situation. Now the little girl from Queens is one of the queens of the music industry!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-and-his-mom-were-partners><strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> And His Mom Were Partners</strong></h2><p>Would you believe that The Wolf of Wall Street star was once homeless for a period in his life?</p><p><strong>Actor Leonardo DiCaprio grew up living with his single mom and she had to take many jobs in order to support&nbsp;their family.</strong></p><p>They lived in some less-than-desirable areas of L.A., but without much money, it was all they could afford. All that changed when DiCaprio landed his first role, and things have only gotten better and better for the star who is estimated to be worth $200 million! With movies like Titanic, The Revenant, Inception, Catch Me if You Can, The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Great Gatsby under his belt, fans can attest to the fact that this celeb is a true Hollywood star. He is still one of the hottest actors in the biz and his A-list status will surely last a lifetime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jay-z-wasn-t-so-innocent-back-in-the-day><strong><a href=#>Jay-Z</a> Wasn't So Innocent Back In The Day</strong></h2><p>Rapper Jay-Z is one of the most successful rappers of our time, but there was a period in his life when he was poor and living a life of crime. Jay-Z grew up in the projects in Brooklyn and used to sell substances. The rapper has come a long way since those dark days now that he is a millionaire, married to the fabulous Beyoncé, and continues to make music that fans can’t get enough of. Some of Jay Z’s greatest hits include “Empire State of Mind,” “Family Feud,” “Young Forever,” “Renegade,” “Holy Grail,” and “Can’t Knock the Hustle,” to name a few. At 48 years old, this star is in the prime of his life and must feel so blessed that his days of poverty are long gone but never forgotten.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-lived-with-rats><strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>&nbsp;Lived With Rats</strong></h2><p>Before the 23-year-old singer Justin Bieber made it big in the music biz, he was living a hard life in the poorhouse, sleeping on a pull-out couch in a rat-infested home with his mom.</p><p><strong>There were numerous nights where he’d go to bed hungry and things seemed bleak.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But with raw talent like his, Bieber was discovered, and things went from dreary to divine. These days, Bieber is a millionaire thanks to his hit music and tons of fans worldwide. Some of the celeb’s songs include, “Baby,” “Love Yourself,” “Boyfriend,” “Mistletoe,” “Beauty and a Beat,” “One Less Lonely Girl,” and “All That Matters.” He is a teenage girl’s dream boat and his star power isn’t fading. Rags to riches is this fella’s life story. He is still a young man, so there is so much more in store for “The Biebs.”</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-was-left-on-the-street><strong>Kelly Clarkson Was Left On The Street&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Fans from all over the world think that American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson is one of the best singers and entertainers of our time.

Clarkson must pinch herself every now and then when she thinks of how far she has come, with hit songs including, “Stronger,” “Breakaway,” “Piece by Piece,” and “Since U Been Gone.”</p><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-worked-her-way-to-the-top><strong>Oprah Winfrey Worked Her Way To The Top</strong></h2><p>Oprah Winfrey is one of the richest people in the world, but it was not always that way.

From there, she found fame on the small and big screen and is estimated to be worth $90 million. She is happily married to actor Matthew Broderick and has three young children. Things went from broke to “bling” for “Carrie Bradshaw!” She now stars on the HBO show, Divorce, so she is still making plenty of coin in the acting world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-wahlberg-did-time><strong>Mark Wahlberg Did Time</strong></h2><p>The 46-year-old actor Mark Wahlberg is one of the hottest A-listers of the moment and has been in the biz for a number of years.

Now he is a millionaire, proving that poverty can lead to a better future.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-didn-t-give-up-on-her-career><strong>Mariah Carey Didn't Give Up On Her Career&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Singer Mariah Carey is one of the most popular stars of our time. She has been at it for decades, recording hit after hit with her impressive multi-octave vocals. But before this “diva” made her multi-millions, she was a poor child, teen, and young adult with the hopes of fame in her future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She grew up in New York and had to work extra hard to make ends meet.
