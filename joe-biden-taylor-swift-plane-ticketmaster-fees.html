For the time being, it seems like Biden is doing his very best to keep Swift content. In the latest act, Biden signed off on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bill that makes it impossible to track Taylor Swift's private jet.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yahoo Entertainment wrote, "An amendment in the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill that was passed last week will allow private aircraft owners to anonymize their registration information. President Joe Biden signed the FAA bill into law on May 16th, after it passed in the Senate 88-4 and the House 387 to 26."</strong></p><p>Tracking jets has been made possible due to aircraft owners being forced to register where they are. That seems to be changing, and it is happening at the perfect time for Swift, who is facing heat over the constant use of her jet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-11.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-15-most-popular-songs-spotify-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)">Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's top Spotify streams will likely be changing in accordance with the popularity of 'The Tortured Poets Department' songs.</p><p>Swifties got some positive news of their own as well. In what is deemed as an attempt to win more votes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biden is removing junk fees</a>, especially with the likes of TicketMaster, as costs to watch Taylor Swift's shows have grown to be unaffordable for some families.</p><p>NPR wrote, "[Biden's] not saying junk fees are bad — period," the official said. "He's using it to tell the broader story about competition and the need to make sure there's a fair and level playing field for businesses, to make sure that people understand what they're getting upfront."</p><p><strong>Biden himself also commented on the matter. He said, "The American people are tired of being played for suckers. No matter how much money you make, no matter how rich or poor or middle class you are, you don't like being taken advantage of."</strong></p><p>Some major moves by Biden. But still, Swift hasn't formally supported the current President.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-still-hasn-39-t-endorsed-joe-biden-despite-being-urged-to-do-so-by-others>Taylor Swift Still Hasn't Endorsed Joe Biden Despite Being Urged To Do So By Others</h2><p>At the moment, Taylor Swift hasn't supported any President, and this really shouldn't come as a surprise. Given her diverse fanbase, it might be in Tay's best interest to lie low on the matter. However, she's feeling the pressure from others. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood director Rob Reiner urged Taylor to support Biden</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52967254.jpg><p>He wrote on X, "I'm in the midst of shooting a sequel to This is Spinal Tap. As much as I'd like Taylor Swift to do a cameo in the film, I'd give anything for her to endorse Joe Biden. She would virtually single-handedly save American Democracy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should be noted that Swift did support Biden during his 2020 run, while she didn't do the same for <strong><a href=#>Donald Trump</a></strong>. Still, at the moment, she hasn't outright supported the current President. She seems to be occupied with her current tour taking over Europe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dl7alsc1mq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZaChrq%2BxjK2gnKOVqbqiv9OeqWaelZrAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joel-mchale-says-tom-bradys-jeff-ross-warning-at-roast-was-a-bit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joel McHale Says Tom Bradys Jeff Ross Warning at Roast Was A Bit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-simpson-lists-california-mansion-22-million-relocating-tennessee.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Simpson Lists California Mansion For $22 Million After Relocating To Tennessee</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
