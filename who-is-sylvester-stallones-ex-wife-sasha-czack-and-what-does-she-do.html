They were married for much of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the time that Stallone played Rocky</a> but they ended up divorcing in 1985. Quickly after his first divorce, Stallone married his Rocky IV co-star, Brigitte Nielsen, but that marriage only lasted two years.</p><p>Stallone had two sons with Czack, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sage, who died in 2012 of heart disease</a>, and Seargeoh. Despite being known as Stallone's wife from 1974 to 1985, she has had a successful career of her own.</p><p>Here's what Czack is doing today.</p><h2 id=she-has-a-degree-in-media-studies-from-notre-dame>She Has A Degree In Media Studies From Notre Dame</h2><p>Czack was born Alexandra Jane Czack in 1950 in Pennsylvania. Not much is known about her childhood, but she did eventually attend the University of Notre Dame and graduated with a degree in media studies.</p><p>After college, she became a photographer and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received praise from Andy Warhol</a>. He even allegedly wrote about her in his diaries. Around this time she also started looking for acting jobs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She landed a role in the CBS soap opera Love of Life, but her IMDb page does not specify which episodes she appeared in. The role ended up leading her to director Frank Perry.</p><p>In 1972, she was offered the lead role in Play It as It Lays but she had to turn it down because Stallone, who was her fiance at the time, wanted her to stay with him and help write the screenplay for what became Rocky.</p><p>She got a job as a waitress during the time he was filming the movie, while also working on the film's still photography.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Sparked The On-Set Fight Between Sylvester Stallone And Richard Gere</a></span></p><p>We don't know how the pair met, but if Czack was hanging out with the likes of Andy Warhol in the '70s, and Stallone was often seen at places like Studio 54 in New York, you can put two and two together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They apparently had an enormous wedding with tons of people from the showbiz world in attendance. Two years later, they welcomed their first son, Sage. In 1979, they had their son, Seargeoh, who was diagnosed with autism at a young age.</p><p>Czack appeared as a woman exercising in a gym in her husband's Rocky III, but after that, her acting career dwindled.</p><p>After years of trying to make their marriage work, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stallones separated</a>, due to living in separate worlds. Stallone was constantly working while Czack tried to find a cure for their son.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Sylvester Stallone Decided To Pursue Acting</a></span></p><p>Czack&nbsp;told People, "I knew that Sly couldn’t get as involved because of his work. We do what we have to do. So I just said, 'Give me the money, and I’ll take care of it.'"</p><p>"It really was the turning point in Sasha’s life," Stallone said on Czack's fight to cure her son. "Her dreams and aspirations have been rechanneled into dedicated research. She is a driven person in that area. All of her priorities are geared toward finding a cure. There is no fun in the future that way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Czack wound up getting $12 million from Stallone in the divorce settlement.</p><h2 id=she-went-on-to-marry-another-person-in-showbiz>She Went On To Marry Another Person In Showbiz</h2><p>Twelve years after divorcing Stallone, Czack married sound engineer, Rick Ash, who has worked on 240 films and television shows.</p><p>Some of the more famous titles he's worked on include Pulp Fiction, Buffalo ‘66, Monster’s Ball, and Captain Fantastic. He also has twelve Emmy nominations and three wins in the Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Miniseries Or A Movie category.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pandemic Won’t Slow Down Sylvester Stallone</a></span></p><p>Czack and Ash have apparently divorced but it not clear when.</p><p>Not much is known about her life after her second divorce either. She carried on looking after her kids and worked with various charities and foundations relating to autism.&nbsp;In 1996 she wrote and directed the short Long Lost Love, and in 2006, she appeared in her son Sage's film Vic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Stallone has moved on to marry Falvin and start a new family with their three girls, Czack has become relatively unknown and lives a private life as her son's caretaker.</p><p>You'd think being the wife of Sylvester Stallone would warrant more interviews with her, but it's quite the opposite. Czack is probably the only person to have known Stallone during the height of his popularity, during all four Rocky films.</p><p>All we know is that she seems like a very loyal and dedicated person who puts her family's lives before hers. She swept her career away to help Stallone's and she continues to help her son. Her nickname should be the Italian Stallion.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Tom Cruise The Same Height As Sylvester Stallone?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv9ilrZ6rpJq%2Fbr%2FTmqOlp56awG6x12auop6VYsCiv8eaZJyykZi4bq3NnWSwoJGpeqW7xKxkrKCVYrGwew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-owns-sheraton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Owns Sheraton?
