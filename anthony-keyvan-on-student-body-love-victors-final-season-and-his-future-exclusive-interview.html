I mean, I pretty much set up Harley and Austin. If you talk to them, they'll probably say the same thing. I facilitated that severely.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Playing matchmaker!</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Yes, absolutely. We were all staying in the same house. I could tell, I was like, "Oh my gosh," and they were playing love interests in the film. It was so serendipitous. I made it happen. Neither of them wanted to talk to each other, they were so scared, and I was like, "Mm-mm, you need to talk to her. You need to talk to him. He's feeling this way. She's feeling that way." Then, I became best friends with Harley, she's my sister. I seriously couldn't imagine my life without her. Cheyenne and Montse, same thing, I love those humans so much. I could go on and on all day about them.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>I'm happy to let you gush!
