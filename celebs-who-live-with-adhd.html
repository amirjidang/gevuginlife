With counseling apps like Talkspace and Better Health, mental healthcare is available to more people than ever and clinicians and public figures have worked hard to destigmatize the practice of seeking therapy, medication, and support for mental health issues. One condition at the forefront of these conversations is ADHD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Paris Hilton's Mom Dishes On Her Daughter's Upcoming Wedding Amid 'Pregnancy'</a></span></p><p>Previously associated with young hyperactive boys, incapable of sitting still in a classroom, ADHD is now understood to be much more pervasive - and much more complex.&nbsp;We now know that ADHD has two different main iterations: hyperactive and inattentive, with some people experiencing a "combination" type. The condition affects adults differently than children, and females differently than males. There is still so much we don't know, but we're finding out that the condition affects more than we ever might have thought.&nbsp;Here are 10 celebrities who have revealed their ADHD diagnoses and <a href=#>lent their voices</a> to visibility and destigmatization efforts.</p><h2 id=britney-spears><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Britney Spears</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney Spears' mental health has been at the center of the evolving story about her <a href=#>abusive conservatorship</a>, but ADHD hasn't been part of the picture. She was diagnosed with the disorder as a teenager and had to take breaks while filming to manage her symptoms. Currently, she is not medicated for ADHD and she is in a stable state, making the conservatorship that much <a href=#>more heartbreaking</a> and infuriating.</p><h2 id=michael-jordan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael Jordan</span></h2><p>Even&nbsp;with an ADHD diagnosis, Michael Jordan became the <a href=#>greatest basketball player of all time</a>, and now some experts are questioning whether <a href=#>athletic giftedness</a> might actually be&nbsp;caused by ADHD, in some part, rather than&nbsp;in spite of it. One theory is that high-intensity sports might help to quell ADHD symptoms, and that those with ADHD thrive in sports&nbsp;with short bursts of energy, like&nbsp;basketball or swimming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paris Hilton</span></h2><p>Paris Hilton revealed to Larry King in a 2007 interview that she was diagnosed with ADD as a child and has taken medication for it for years.&nbsp;"Have you ever been addicted to drugs?" Larry King pressed, appearing to be trying to get her to admit other vices or behavior problems.&nbsp;Paris was adamant that she had not and that her ADHD medication was simply medication for a condition.</p><h2 id=simone-biles><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Simone Biles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simone Biles is another athlete that makes the case for ADHD correlating with athletic talent. The US gymnast's medical records were leaked, revealing the diagnosis, but Simone was quick to&nbsp;respond publicly: "Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing that I’m afraid to let people know."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Simone Biles' Height & 9 Other Facts About The Olympic Gold Medalist</a></span></p><h2 id=howie-mandel><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Howie Mandel</span></h2><p>Howie Mandel impulsive revealed on a talk show that <a href=#>he had OCD and ADHD</a> and was quickly regretful of the choice. But he explains that the outpouring of support changed his mind: "I was approached by all kinds of people saying, ‘Me too.’ Those were two of the most comforting words I’ve ever heard."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-carville><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>James Carville</span></h2><p>In terms of celebs with ADHD, this has got to be one of the most comforting revelations. Political analyst and commentator James Carville has struggled with ADHD for most of his adult life, but credits the condition with giving him the razor sharp focus he needs in short bursts to succeed in politics.</p><h2 id=emma-watson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Emma Watson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Harry Potter&nbsp;and Little Women&nbsp;star is an alum of both Brown University and Oxford University, and a straight-A student too.She was medicated throughout Harry Potter filming, but her ADHD has never gotten in the way of pursuing her dreams, both academic and creative, and she continues to succeed in film and in her work around women's rights, proving ADHD does not have to be a death sentence to any person's ambitions.</p><h2 id=dave-grohl><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dave Grohl</span></h2><p>Foo Fighters frontman and Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl posted a video to YouTube called <a href=#>"In Defense of Our Teachers,"</a> in which he&nbsp;revealed that he'd been a terrible student, challenged by his ADHD, and only wanted to play music. ADHD has frequently been associated with outstanding creative abilities and a distaste for more academic subjects, and Dave Grohl is just one more convincing case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-bieber><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Justin Bieber</span></h2><p>Many have taken easy jabs at Justin Bieber's mental health over the years, but&nbsp;it's possible some of his erratic behavior could be attributed to ADHD. He was medicated for a while, but explained that it was giving him anxiety and that he was hoping to get off of it soon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Say Justin Bieber Has ‘Changed’ After He Asked Fans To Stop Crowding Near His Home</a></span></p><h2 id=solange-knowles><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Solange Knowles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Solange Knowles often has so much energy that people think she's high when she's sober, she says.
