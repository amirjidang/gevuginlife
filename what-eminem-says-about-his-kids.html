With a career spanning over two decades, the rapper, born Marshall Bruce Mathers, has created a recognizable sound that he has remained true to, likely earning him the global recognition he has. But it's not just his rap style. Eminem is a lyrical genius with a way of crafting and stitching his bars that is utterly remarkable.</p><p>The singer is one of the fastest in the world, with his style earning him a world record holder title. He can be fast, but his lyrics always remain coherent enough for his fans to internalize and relate to. However, fans may only have a sliver of information about the famous producer and rapper's personal life. Despite a tough demeanor, Eminem is a softie when it comes to his children, and he seems to work hard at maintaining a close bond with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/eminem-anderson-cooper.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Anderson Cooper's Iconic Interview With Eminem Was Harder Than It Looked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anderson Cooper's long-ago interview with Eminem was a logistical nightmare — and also super awkward.</span><h2 id=in-an-interview-eminem-was-asked-about-one-daughter>In An Interview, Eminem Was Asked About One Daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nside-eminem-s-relationship-with-daughter-alaina-marie-scott-s-mysterious-husband-matt-moeller.jpg><p>Eminem loves his daughter; that is undeniable. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The "Without Me" rapper has three known children</a>, Hailie Jade Mathers, Alaina Marie, and Stevie Laine.</p><p>Hailie, born in 1995, is the rapper’s first and only biological daughter with his ex-wife Kimberly Scott.

She’s made me proud, for sure. She graduated from college, 3.9,” he answered when asked about his biological daughter.</p><p>However, he went on to talk about his other two children even though he wasn’t asked about them, something that speaks a lot about how he feels about all of them. But this shouldn’t be a surprise, as Eminem has always been big on family and fatherhood. <a href=#>Alaine even credits Eminem for making his wedding possible</a>.</p><p>"Even before Hailie was born, I was a firm believer in freedom of speech … But once I hit them gates where I live, that's when I'm Dad.

People at rehab were stealing my hats and pens and notebooks and asking for autographs.
