The town of Charleston looks great on camera, the cast is going to fight during dinners and vacations, and Whitney Sudler-Smith's mother Patricia Altschul is going to be endlessly entertaining. <a href=#>Patricia's gorgeous Southern Charm house</a> is often the star of the show, but so is the cast member herself. Patricia loves caftans, a well-made cocktail, and throwing fancy parties (that go off the rails because, hey, this is a reality show after all).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Whitney and Patricia seem to get along when hanging out at her elegant home, is that actually the truth? What is Whitney Sudler-Smith and Patricia Altschul's real relationship like?</p><h2 id=are-whitney-sudler-smith-and-patricia-altschul-actually-close>Are Whitney Sudler-Smith And Patricia Altschul Actually Close?</h2><p>It was a surprise to fans when Whitney Sudler-Smith and Naomie Olindo began casually dating in season 8 of Southern Charm. While Whitney is stylish, loves rock and roll music, and is open about how silly he sometimes thinks his co-stars are, he isn't known for sharing a lot about his love life.</p><p><a href=#>Whitney's relationship with ex Larissa Marolt</a> wasn't mentioned much on the reality show, and Whitney often seems cool, calm, and collected. It was also a shock since Whitney and Naomie had been co-stars for so many years and sparks never flew between the two of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/whitney-sudler-smith-patricia-altschul-southern-charm.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Whitney spoke about liking Naomie, and his mother Patricia has been chatty about that short-term relationship as well. She said that she is a fan of Naomie and joked about Whitney needing to settle down and get married while she's still alive.</p><p>The fact that Patricia often comments on her son's dating life suggests that there is a genuine closeness there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/naomie-olindo-whitney-sudler-smith-southern-charm.jpg><p>This wasn't the first time that Patricia has shared her thoughts about who Whitney is dating. Several seasons earlier, Whitney and Kathryn Dennis were briefly romantically involved, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia was interviewed by Entertainment Tonight</a> and spoke about that situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patricia told Entertainment Tonight, "What can I say? I live in one wing of the house, and at that time, Whitney was living at the other wing. And I think that this whole contrivance that there was a relationship is misconstrued. I mean... I don't like to use the term one night stand. I prefer 'sleepover.' I think this was just a good, old-fashioned Southern sleepover. I mean, I never saw her in the house except once.‚Äù</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is How Whitney Sudler-Smith From Southern Charm Is So Unbelievably Rich</a></span></p><p>Patricia seems to know what's going on in Whitney's personal life, and if they were really only close when the cameras were rolling on Southern Charm, it seems that she would be kept in the dark. Whitney never seems irritated by his mother's comments, either, which seems to prove that they have a warm and affectionate bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whitney-sudler-smith-and-patricia-altschul-best-moments-on-southern-charm>Whitney Sudler-Smith And Patricia Altschul Best Moments On Southern Charm</h2><p>The fact that the mother and son continue to appear on Southern Charm also suggests that they really do get along. If they didn't, it seems that either one of them would decide to bow out of the series, especially since it has been on the air since 2013.</p><p>Episode 12 of season 8, "Guys And Dolls," features a "Gentlemen's Dinner" that Patricia throws for the male co-stars with a French theme complete with escargot, duck, and a flambe dessert. Whitney and Patricia's funny banter and close bond is clear throughout the episode.</p><p>When a woman named Becky served them champagne, Patricia said "I prefer champagne in a coupe, don't you?" and Whitney got up to get his mother the right glass. He said, "Mom can be exacting" and added that because she's 81 years old, she can be picky. Things got even funnier when Patricia complained that Whitney gave her a paper napkin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/whitney-sudler-smith.jpg><p>Even though Patricia definitely wants things to be done the way that she wants them, she's a good sport about it, and she seems to genuinely enjoy being Southern Charm. While Whitney has a house in Los Angeles, according to Bravo TV, he seems to spend a good deal of time at his mother's house, whether they're filming the reality series or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast of Bravo's Southern Charm Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><p>Patricia often speaks positively about her son, and it does seem like they have a close mother/son relationship. When she appeared at BravoCon 2022 and a fan asked about Whitney not attending, Patricia said, "He's very private... ‚Äú[Whitney] likes to come on [the show] and make snarky comments and then leave. He likes to kind of stir the pot and then stand back," according to Bravo TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whitney-sudler-smith-wanted-patricia-altschul-to-star-on-southern-charm>Whitney Sudler-Smith Wanted Patricia Altschul To Star On Southern Charm</h2><p>Whitney Sudler-Smith created Southern Charm, but of course, that doesn't automatically mean that his mother would want to be a cast member. It would have been easy for Patricia Altschul to turn it down and say that she wanted to live a more private life.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia spoke about joining the Southern Charm cast</a> with Bravo's The Daily Dish and said that it was going to be a small part at first. She said, "He did tell me at the beginning, 'Just be on it for five minutes and that's all you have to do.' And now he says, 'Mother, please don't talk too much. Watch what you say. Edit what you say.' And, of course, I just say whatever pops into my head. But I think that gives him ulcers."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/southern-charm-patricia-altschul.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patricia told Entertainment Tonight that she wouldn't have thought that she would star on a reality series. She said, "I mean, at my age, I'd thought I'd be sitting on my chaise, eating bonbons and reading trashy novels. Or looking for a new husband -- something kind of fun. Now they've got me working ‚Ä¶ Whitney has me on this show!‚Äù</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Southern Charm's Shep Rose Live A Life Of Insane Luxury Like His Impressive Net Worth Suggests?</a></span></p><p>She added in the same interview, "He wanted to give me just a little walk-on part. I bet Whitney wished he'd kept me off the show!"</p><p>While Patricia has a strong sense of humor and often jokes about Whitney not wanting her to have such a large role on the series, he definitely seems to enjoy having her be part of it. Even if they both get upset with the drama sometimes, being Southern Charm co-stars allows the two to spend even more time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWjpMK1tMSrpWabmJa6s3nCmqqtZaedtrW6xLJkrK2UobKzedKmoK2gXZa7pXnHoqpmpZ%2Bptaa%2BjKmYraqZmLaiecClq6ybmKq5tHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkn5mbmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jared-goff-lists-his-hidden-hills-l-a-california-mansion-for-6-4-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jared Goff Lists His Hidden Hills, L.A California Mansion For $6.4 Million</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-tim-hardaway-jr-married-to-wife-or-dating-girlfriend-522160-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Is Tim Hardaway Jr. Married to Wife?
