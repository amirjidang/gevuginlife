Because not only did he add a massive tattoo to his neck, but he also colored his<a href=#> bleached buzz cut</a> a bright blue.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Let’s break it down, shall we? <a href=#>The Voice alum</a> has tested out pink in the past and rocked platinum locks. Levine has even stepped out with a totally shaved head, a faux hawk, a mohawk, long locks — the list goes on.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But when he stepped out — shirtless no less — in Los Angeles, it was his bright blue hair that stole the show. Because there’s no question that the icy hue may be the musician’s best look yet.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And as if dyeing his hair wasn’t enough to send his fan base into an all out tizzy, the Maroon 5 frontman also took the opportunity to pay a visit to tattoo artist <strong>Nathan Kostechko</strong> for quite the large design.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Levine decided on an intricate creation that <a href=#>depicted a butterfly</a> getting trapped in a spider web. He had the piece inked front and center on his neck.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Adam Levine really went for it on this one,” Kostechko captioned an image of the singer’s fresh tattoo. It’s positioned just above his “family” tattoo and adjacent to his leaf design.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The “Girls Like You” singer also shared a close-up image of his new ink with his 13.7 million Instagram followers. “Wise man once said … ‘when Instagram goes down … tattoo your throat …’ his name was @nathan_kostechko,” Levine wrote.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>It didn’t take long for fans to jump into the comments section and show some love for Levine’s latest ink. “THAT’S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING,” a user wrote. Another person added: “DUDE!!!!!!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>It’s soooooooooo dope !!!!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>This isn’t the first new tattoo Levine has added to his collection. In August he tapped artist <strong>Bill Canales</strong> for a leg design that took a casual 13 hours to complete.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Six months earlier, he worked with Kostechko to create a large design of ocean waves on his left leg. The artwork was so big, that it took a full three days to complete. “Today was ouch but worth it,” he captioned an Instagram Stories at the time.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5axormMpZyvoZ6aeqXFxKxkoZmZp3qjvsign61lkqHCpnnGnqusZZKqwbWx0Z%2BjsmWklsG1u85mm56skZ65tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alessa-quizon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-55052-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alessa Quizon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-things-you-didnt-know-about-loki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Things You Didn't Know About Loki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
