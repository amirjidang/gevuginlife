Thank you for listening. I love you. This album is dedicated to the light of my life, my beloved partner and best friend Evans Richardson, who passed away in April,” Stevens, 48, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Friday, October 6. “He was an absolute gem of a person, full of life, love, laughter, curiosity, integrity and joy. He was one of those rare and beautiful ones you find only once in a lifetime — precious, impeccable, and absolutely exceptional in every way.”</p><p class=p1>The Grammy-nominated musician had never previously addressed <a href=#>his relationship status or sexuality</a> prior to Friday’s social media upload.</p><p class=p1>A photo of Richardson, who died at the age of 43, lounging on a bed was posted alongside Stevens’ caption. According to a <a href=# rel=noopener>Dignity Memorial</a> obituary originally published on April 30, Evans Richardson IV hailed from St. Louis, Missouri, before relocating to New York. He served as the chief of staff at Harlem’s Studio Museum, an institution dedicated to the work of African-American artists, for nearly 11 years. A cause of death has not been shared.</p><p class=p1>It is <a href=#>not known when Stevens and Richardson began dating</a>, though Stevens’ Friday note hinted at their romantic dynamic.</p><p class=p1>“I know relationships can be very difficult sometimes, but it’s always worth it to put in the hard work and care for the ones you love, especially the beautiful ones, who are few and far between,” Stevens penned. “If you happen to find that kind of love, hold it close, hold it tight, savor it, tend to it, and give it everything you’ve got, especially in times of trouble. Be kind, be strong, be patient, be forgiving, be vigorous, be wise, and be yourself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Singer-Sufjan-Stevens-Publicly-Comes-Out-by-Dedicating-New-Album-to-Late-Partner-Evans-Richardson-02.jpg><p class=p1>He concluded: “Live every day as if it is your last, with fullness and grace, with reverence and love, with gratitude and joy. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.”</p><p class=p1>Stevens recently underwent <a href=#>treatment for Guillain-Barré Syndrome</a> ahead of <i>Javelin</i>’s release.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’m very excited about having new music to share, but I just wanted to let you know that one of the reasons why I haven’t been able to participate in the press and promotion leading up to the release of <i>Javelin</i> is [because] <a href=#>I am in the hospital</a>,” he wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in September. “Last month I woke up one morning and couldn’t walk. My hands, arms and legs were numb and tingling and I had no strength, no feeling, no mobility. My brother drove me to the ER and after a series of tests — MRIs, EMGs, cat scans, X-rays, spinal taps (!), echo-cardiograms, etc. — the neurologists diagnosed me with an autoimmune disorder called Guillian-Barre Syndrome.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “Luckily there’s treatment for this — they administer immuno-hemoglobin infusions for five days and pray that the disease doesn’t spread to the lungs, heart and brain. Very scary, but it worked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoZ6csrN50q6do5meYsC1sdWepaxlk6S6pr%2BMqKytZZSasaqvwK2crGWemsRurcubrKZlpKR6ra3TnmSpmaKpu6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snapped-on-oxygen-who-is-falicia-blakely-and-what-did-she-do-624993-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snapped on Oxygen: Who is Falicia Blakely and what did she do?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shelley-conn-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shelley Conn Net Worth How Much is Shelley Conn Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
