Such was the case with Usher and Timberlake. But are the rumors of a feud valid? Were the two artists ever facing off? And where does Justin Bieber fit into all of this?</p><h2 id=timbaland-said-he-wants-to-see-justin-and-usher-face-off-in-a-39-verzuz-39-battle>Timbaland Said He Wants To See Justin And Usher Face Off In A 'Verzuz' Battle</h2><p>Verzuz is the webcast series created by Timbaland and Swizz Beatz. The webseries was created during the pandemic as a virtual DJ battle, with each producer choosing two artists to battle with.</p><p>During an appearance on the Jalen & Jacoby podcast in 2021, <a href=#>Timbaland and Swizz Beatz spoke about potential future episodes</a>. The podcast is hosted by NBA analyst Jalen Rose and ESPN host David Jacoby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose asked about a potential face off between Usher and Justin Timberlake. Timbaland was very interested in the possibility and revealed that Drake even expressed the idea to him as well.</p><p>"Yes, we know," Timbaland said laughing. "It's so funny, Drake hit me up about that one too. He was like, 'We gotta make that happen, we gotta make that happen.' I'm like, 'Soon to come, soon to come.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mila Kunis Slammed A Russian Reporter For Asking Justin Timberlake Why He's In Movies</a></span></p><p>Rose also pitched a battle between Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes, who he considered to be "terrific writers, performers and entertainers with amazing longevity." Timbaland agreed and revealed that he was working on getting Elliot on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It is, to me, the best party that could ever happen on Verzuz," Timbaland said. "It's just a matter of the comfort zone of my sister [and having her want] to celebrate with her brother and understand that it's not competition, it's a party. I've been working on that and talking to her, but I think that would be an amazing Verzuz."</p><p>The show became famous for reuniting artists that many believed to be engaged in beefs with one another. Brandy and Monica appeared on the show and put those rumors to rest. Another episode featured Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy. Therefore, many were hopeful an episode between Usher and Timberlake would materialize, considering the ongoing rumors of a feud between the two.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-and-usher-once-battled-over-justin-bieber-39-s-recording-career>Justin Timberlake And Usher Once Battled Over Justin Bieber's Recording Career</h2><p>In 2009, Justin Bieber was beginning to feel the pressure of newfound fame. At just 15 years old, he was becoming a fixture on YouTube and started to gain an impressive following on Twitter. He also found himself at the center of a bidding war between record labels. Timberlake and Usher were the two main figures at the center of the battle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar48351977.jpg><p>In the end, Usher won the label bidding war for Bieber. The young hopeful was not yet a star, but filled with dreams for his future.</p><p>"My manager found me on YouTube," <a href=#>Bieber said in an interview</a> with MTV News. "He actually flew me out to Atlanta for the first time. I was going to the studio to meet some people."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Shares BTS Studio Session With Usher</a></span></p><p>Bieber also shared a story of his first encounter with Usher. "Usher happens to roll up in his Range Rover, so I was like, 'Man, that's Usher.' So I ran up to him." However, Usher turned down the opportunity to hear the future star sing on the spot. He did eventually come around though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He actually watched my videos and was like, 'Man, I should have let this kid sing,'" Bieber said. "And he flew me back to Atlanta. I got to sing for him, and then a week later, I had a meeting with Justin Timberlake. They both kind of wanted me."</p><h1>Usher Has Denied Any Feud With Justin Timberlake</h1><p>In the early 2000s, the rumors of a rivalry between Usher and Timberlake were in full swing. The two singers were enjoying great success. Usher told The Boston Globe in 2004, however, that <a href=#>he wasn't in a feud with Timberlake</a>.</p><p>"I’m not in competition with Justin. I’m not in competition with anyone but myself," he said. "I’m not looking for that bad-boy image, I’m not a person who goes out looking for trouble."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar51517894.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was rumored that the two singers were feuding after Rolling Stone chose Timberlake as "the new King of Pop" over Usher.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Timberlake Has Joined TikTok And Fans Think It's A Sign Of A New Album</a></span></p><p>At the time, Usher was riding high on the success of his "Confessions" album, which had already sold five million copies. MTV and radio stations were also playing the singles "Yeah!," "Burn" and "Confessions Part II" in heavy rotation.</p><p>"It’s not just about a hit record, it’s not just the marketing behind an album, it’s about the talent, and I go out there and I work hard," Usher said. "No one can just take your spot. If you really work hard, no one can take your spot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmoqWowaq6jK2gppqVp7mit8RmmKecXarAqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-bobby-wooten-net-worth-2022-recent-photos-of-katie-holmes-with-her-new-boyfriend-make-the-news-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Bobby Wooten Net Worth?
