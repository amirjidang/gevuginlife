They have each achieved great success in their careers, becoming household names for their hilarious performances on television and in film. But what many people may not know is that these three women share a unique bond that has lasted for years – a friendship that is as bizarre as it is enduring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Great Female Celebrity Friendships That Have Stood The Test Of Time</a></span></p><p>Sure, <a href=#>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are known as best friends</a>. What fans don't know is that Louis-Dreyfus, the iconic Seinfeld actress who paved the way for these two comedians, exists as a weird third wheel for them at times. Here's how odd their friendship truly is.</p><h2 id=how-did-julia-louis-dreyfus-meet-amy-poehler-and-tina-fey>How Did Julia Louis-Dreyfus Meet Amy Poehler And Tina Fey?</h2><p>The three women come from different backgrounds and have distinct personalities that somehow meshed together perfectly. According to Screen Rant, Julia Louis-Dreyfus first met Tina Fey and Amy Poehler when the Veep star hosted Saturday Night Live back in 2006. <a href=#>Despite disliking her time with SNL</a>, Louis-Dreyfus immediately hit it off with the two comedians.</p><p>The origins of their friendships are quite peculiar because they all come from different walks of life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nicki Swift</a>, Louis-Dreyfus grew up in a wealthy family and had a privileged upbringing, while Fey and Poehler both grew up as middle-class Americans. Despite these differences, they share a common love for comedy, which brought them together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jerry-seinfeld-and-julia-louis-dreyfus-filming-seinfeld.jpg><p>It's interesting to note that while Louis-Dreyfus was already an established actress before meeting Fey and Poehler, she felt intimidated by them at first. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Vanity Fair</a>, she admitted to being nervous about working with them in any capacity because they were such comedic powerhouses.</p><p>Their bond only strengthened over time as they continued to work together on various projects like hosting the Golden Globes three times between 2013-2015. They also appeared on each other's shows like Parks and Recreation (Poehler) and Veep (Louis-Dreyfus). Their chemistry was undeniable both on-screen and off-screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What President Joe Biden Really Thought About Working With Amy Poehler On Parks And Rec</a></span></p><p>The origins of Louis-Dreyfus's bizarre friendships with Fey and Poehler are rooted in their shared love for comedy despite coming from different backgrounds. Their friendship is a testament to the fact that sometimes the most unlikely people can become the best of friends. Their bond has only grown stronger over time, and fans can't get enough of their hilarious antics both on-screen and off-screen.</p><h2 id=how-julia-louis-dreyfus-amy-poehler-and-tina-fey-changed-the-world-of-comedy>How Julia Louis Dreyfus, Amy Poehler, And Tina Fey Changed The World Of Comedy</h2><p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus's friendships with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are nothing short of bizarre, but what is even more intriguing is their shared humor and comedic styles. All three women are known for their sharp wit and impeccable timing, which has made them some of the most beloved comedians in the industry. Their ability to make light of even the most serious situations is a testament to their talent and creativity, and it is this shared sense of humor that has brought them together time and time again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/everything-to-know-about-julia-louis-dreyfus-s-bizarre-friendships-with-tina-fey-and-amy-poehler-copy.jpg><p>One of the most striking aspects of Louis-Dreyfus's friendship with Fey and Poehler is their ability to riff off one another effortlessly. They have an almost telepathic connection when it comes to humor, which allows them to create hilarious moments on the fly. Whether they are performing a sketch together or simply hanging out, they seem to be constantly trying to one-up each other with their jokes.</p><p>Their comedic styles also complement each other perfectly. Louis-Dreyfus's dry wit pairs well with Fey's absurdity, while Poehler brings her trademark energy and physical comedy into the mix. Together, they create a dynamic trio that can make anyone laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was evident <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Louis-Dreyfus pretended to sleep after Poehler announced Julia's Emmy win</a>. Poehler's high energy right before</p><p>It is also worth noting that all three women have had successful careers in both television and film. According to Entertainment Tonight, Fey gained fame as the head writer on Saturday Night Live before creating her own hit show 30 Rock. Poehler made a name for herself on SNL before starring in Parks and Recreation. Louis-Dreyfus, of course, rose to fame as Elaine Benes on Seinfeld before going on to star in The New Adventures of Old Christine and Veep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amy-twitter.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their individual successes, however, these women always seem happiest when they are working together. From hosting award shows like the Golden Globes to appearing in sketches on SNL or guest-starring on each other's shows, they jump at any opportunity to collaborate.</p><h2 id=how-does-julia-louis-dreyfus-truly-feel-about-amy-poehler-and-tina-fey>How Does Julia Louis-Dreyfus Truly Feel About Amy Poehler And Tina Fey?</h2><p>One of the reasons why Julia admires Poehler and Fey is their wit and intelligence when it comes to comedy writing. They have managed to create memorable characters on shows like Saturday Night Live, Parks and Recreation, and 30 Rock which have become iconic in pop culture. These characters are not only funny but also relatable because they reflect real-life situations that people face every day.</p><p>Another reason why Julia admires these two women is their ability to use comedy as a tool for social commentary. They have tackled sensitive topics such as gender inequality, politics, and race with humor without trivializing or downplaying the seriousness of these issues. For instance, during one of her SNL appearances as Sarah Palin in 2008, <a href=#>Fey was able to highlight some of Palin's questionable statements</a> while still making people laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/426FF317-524E-4380-8BAB-570B9E1389FB.jpeg><p>Furthermore, Julia appreciates how Poehler and Fey have used their platforms to uplift other women in the industry. According to Buzzfeed News, both women are known for mentoring young comedians and promoting diversity in Hollywood by creating opportunities for marginalized groups. This is evident in projects like Broad City which was co-created by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer under Poehler's production company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Amy Poehler's New Reality Show About Preparing For Death</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus, like most people, truly admires Poehler and Fey for their comedic talent as well as their impact on society through comedy. Their ability to write witty jokes while shedding light on important issues has earned them respect not just from Julia but also from audiences worldwide. Additionally, their commitment to empowering other women in the industry is something that has not gone unnoticed by Julia and many others who look up to them.</p><p>Despite their busy schedules and demanding careers, their friendship dynamics remain strong.
