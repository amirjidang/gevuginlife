When fans first began watching the show, they quickly learned that teenage girl Hannah Baker was sharing her story and that she believed that the people in her life affected her negatively. As the show continued, there were many other disturbing elements added that weren't part of the book that the show is based on.</p><p>Why did 13 Reasons Why get canceled?

I'm always a little bit suspicious of high school shows that go beyond four seasons because high school is four years long."</p><p>Some fans of the show wonder why the show didn't stop after season 1, since that is the one that follows Jay Asher's young adult novel most closely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan wrote in a Reddit thread, "This was clearly a one-season story" and another viewer replied, "I was shocked there was a season 2. Then there was a third. And now a fourth? How did they even get past the first season?" Another fan shared their opinion: "This is the problem when books are transformed into what should clearly be limited series. The book is a self-contained story. The first season is a self-contained story."</p><p>Season 1 of 13 Reasons Why has a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with a 78% rating on the Tomatometer and 80% Audience Score, compared to 25% on the Tomatometer and 53% Audience Score for season 4.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ’13 Reasons Why’ Actor Miles Heizer Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-controversy>The Controversy</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been several parts of 13 Reasons Why that viewers and critics alike have called inappropriate and thought were too dark to show.</p><p>According to Cinema Blend, season 4 featured a difficult scene when the characters went through a drill for a school shooting, which many found disturbing. In season 2, Tyler is assaulted at school, and Brian Yorkey explained, "As intense as that scene is, and as strong as are or reactions to it may be, it doesn't even come close to the pain experienced by the people who actually go through these things."</p><p>It seems like all four seasons of the show have been viewed as problematic, as episodes have featured difficult topics such as murder and assault, and many people found it difficult to continue watching the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>’13 Reasons Why’: What Has The Cast Been Up To Since The Finale?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hannah-39-s-scene>Hannah's Scene</h2><p>As soon as 13 Reasons Why became available for streaming on Netflix, people realized that season 1 contained a disturbing scene that was very tough to watch: Hannah Baker's suicide scene.</p><p>This became very controversial, with many people saying that it wasn't appropriate, and Netflix made the decision to take the scene out of the show altogether.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, the official statement from Netflix read, “We’ve heard from many young people that 13 Reasons Why encouraged them to start conversations about difficult issues like depression and suicide and get help — often for the first time. As we prepare to launch season three later this summer, we’ve been mindful about the ongoing debate around the show. So on the advice of medical experts, including Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, we’ve decided with creator Brian Yorkey and the producers to edit the scene in which Hannah takes her own life from season one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is The Richest ‘13 Reasons Why’ Cast Member In 2021</a></span></p><p>Brian Yorkey also told EW that after making season 1, it became clear that there was more story to tell with the characters. The showrunner explained, "we fell in love with these characters and wanted to know what happened next. And at that time I wouldn't say there was a plan, but you begin to think, 'It would be interesting to follow these kids.'"</p><p>While the writers and producers had good intentions, the backlash to 13 Reasons Why can't be ignored as many were uncomfortable with the stories and themes explored over four seasons.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>13 Reasons Why: The Cast's Biggest Roles Outside The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6cn%2BMq5yaq5%2BjwG7Dx7JksJmjYrCiusKeo56cXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toni-tennille-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toni Tennille Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-most-expensive-marbles-in-the-world-ranked.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Expensive Marbles In The World, Ranked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
