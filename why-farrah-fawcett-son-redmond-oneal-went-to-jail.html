But he has also endured a public arrest and caused pain and suffering to several individuals, all while struggling with an intense and violent degree of mental illness. O'Neal has been in legal trouble ever since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his latest arrest in 2018</a>, and between firing his attorney and still facing a hefty civil suit, it has not been going well for him.</p><h2 id=who-is-redmond-o-39-neal><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Redmond O'Neal?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, let us get to know the only birth child of Farrah Fawcett a little bit better. O'Neal has a long history of legal problems; in 2008 he was arrested in his Malibu home for narcotics possession, and in 2009, as his mother was dying, <a href=#>he got arrested for DUI and possession of narcotics</a>. He violated probation in 2015 and was then sent to prison for three years. Then, in 2018, the worst of his problems began. But before he was Redmond O'Neal the violent criminal, he was Redmond O'Neal the voice actor and he loaned his voice to The Brave Little Toaster, Johnny Bravo, and several classics of the 90s.</p><h2 id=redmond-o-39-neal-was-caught-robbing-a-liquor-store><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Redmond O'Neal Was Caught Robbing A Liquor Store</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his initial release from prison, he was arrested once again, this time for robbing a convenience store in Santa Monica, California. After his arrest in Santa Monica, police soon realized that Redmond O'Neal was guilty of much more than just armed robbery, however. His sporadic and uncontrollable behavior also led them to believe that he was not of a sound state of mind and that either drugs, mental illness, or both were a factor in the case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Black Panther' Director Ryan Coogler Falsely Arrested For Bank Robbery</a></span></p><h2 id=redmond-o-39-neal-was-linked-to-multiple-violent-crimes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Redmond O'Neal Was Linked To Multiple Violent Crimes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after his 2018 arrest, investigators began to connect the dots and realized that O'Neal was the perpetrator of several other violent crimes that had taken place in Southern California during that week. O'Neal was implicated in a week-long crime spree that included allegations of assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder. One man alleges that O'Neal tried to stab him to death. Although the case against him was very strong, mental health professionals had to be called in.</p><h2 id=redmond-o-39-neal-was-deemed-unfit-for-trial><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Redmond O'Neal Was Deemed Unfit For Trial</span></h2><p>After an evaluation of his mental health, Redmond O'Neal was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder. Upon hearing this, the judge had no choice but to rule that O'Neal was unfit to stand trial and he was transferred to a mental hospital. Experts believe that his poor mental health and his heavy drug and alcohol use triggered his violent episode. O'Neal, however, does not. O'Neal spoke out from prison after finally receiving treatment, and he stated that he believes it was the drugs or alcohol that caused him to lose control, and that his parents are the ones to blame for his actions. Although he avoided a criminal trial, this did not end his legal woes, far from it as a matter of fact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Blac Chyna Vows To Go After The 'Racist' Kardashians In Jury Trial</a></span></p><h2 id=redmond-o-39-neal-is-still-in-legal-trouble><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Redmond O'Neal Is Still In Legal Trouble</span></h2><p>While he no longer faces criminal charges for his incredibly violent crimes, he still faces incredibly financial hardships. The judge ruled that he was unfit to stand a criminal trial, but the person who O'Neal allegedly tried to stab to death was given a thumbs up from the court to pursue a civil case against the former voice actor. To make matters even worse, the stabbing was allegedly racially motivated and therefore <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">qualifies as a hate crime</a>. Things got even weirder in the case when O'Neal <a href=#>fired his defense attorney in 2020.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fyi-redmond-o-39-neal-inherited-millions-from-his-mom><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>FYI Redmond O'Neal Inherited Millions From His Mom</span></h2><p>Wealth can either help or hurt mental illness, one can either use their money to get quality care and treatment and therefore have go on to have <a href=#>great careers and personal lives,</a> or one could use the money to enable their worst habits and triggers. It is so common for celebrity children and former child actors to fall into the latter that it isn't even shocking when it happens anymore. It would appear that O'Neal went down this road and has little chance of coming back from it. The victims of his alleged hate crime are suing for nearly $100 million in damages. O'Neal only inherited $4.5 million when his mother died, and the money was held in a revocable trust, and one can probably imagine why. Mental illness and addiction can be very scary things, and the life and crimes of Redmond O'Neal are proof of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Man Arrested Outside Alexandra Daddario's Home For Possession Of A Concealed Firearm</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66zvsChZJ%2BZp5iytcCMrKanZaKasa67zZ1kqKaVlrluw8Snq2asn2K3orXLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-jenna-ortega-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Wednesday Jenna Ortega's Ticket To A Career That Will Earn Millions?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./helena-bonham-carter-affair-with-kenneth-branagh-relationship-timeline-558757-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Helena Bonham Carter Affair With Kenneth Branagh, Relationship Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-witcher-net-worth-cast-ranked-richest-poorest.html>'The Witcher': The Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-facts-that-prince-harry-discovered-about-meghan-markle-from-the-media.html>15 Facts That Prince Harry Discovered About Meghan Markle From The Media</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rory-gilmore-romantic-relationships-things-we-dont-understand.html>15 Things About Rory Gilmore's Romantic Relationships We Never Understood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-the-punisher-could-do.html>15 Things You Didn't Know The Punisher Could Do</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./game-of-thrones-arya-gendry-relationship.html>25 Messed-Up Revelations About Arya And Gendry's Relationship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe.
