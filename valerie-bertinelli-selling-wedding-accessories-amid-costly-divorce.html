Though she’s unable to rid her life of her estranged husband (for now), she is <a href=#>looking to offload several items</a> from their wedding.</p><p>Sharing with her 1.1 million Instagram followers, <a href=#>Valerie posted an image of items</a> she’s looking to sell – a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes and two rings from Tiffany and Co.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Got $5 Million?

Using a winking emoji, Valerie also implied these were accessories she wore to her wedding to Tom, which took place over a decade ago in 2011.</p><p>“Dropped a few things off with @therealreal,” she wrote. “A couple of Tiffany rings that have some bad memories attached and a pair of shoes I wore to a wedding in January 2011. They should be up in a couple of weeks!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July, it was reported Tom and Valerie were seeking a divorce.

He also wants her to pay $200,000 towards his legal fees, which include paying $50,000 to a forensic accountant to investigate the extent of Valerie’s wealth.</p><p>In his filing, Tom claims that he quit working as an accountant shortly after their marriage to focus on building Valerie’s businesses.</p><p>Now, he says he’s struggling to find work in his field and took a job for $16/hour at Postal Annex while he tries to find something else. Tom argues he’s entitled to spousal support because of all the work he put into Valerie’s companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her part, Valerie is trying to have the original stipulations of their prenup upheld. She was reportedly giving Tom $8,000 per month until recently. She reportedly has $34 million in assets.</p><p>The One Day at a Time alum originally filed for divorce in May, citing “irreconcilable differences.”</p><p>The actress was previously married to Eddie Van Halen from 1981 to 2007, who’s the father of her only child.
